As developers, we often build and deploy, but how much thought do we put into detecting when things go wrong, or when someone's trying to mess with our systems? A "personal" threat detection system isn't about building a full SOC in your living room. It's about gaining visibility, understanding what's normal, and being alerted to anomalies or outright attacks on your individual machines or small home network.

This post will walk you through setting up a pragmatic, open-source threat detection system focusing on common Linux environments. We'll leverage powerful, battle-tested tools to monitor network traffic, file changes, and system activities, then tie it together with a simple alerting mechanism.

### Why Bother with a Personal System?

You might think, "I'm not a target." But every internet-connected device is a target for automated scans, botnet recruitment, or opportunistic attacks. Even a small system can detect:

*   **Unauthorized access attempts**: SSH brute-force, web server exploits.
*   **Malware activity**: Outbound connections to C2 servers, unusual process behavior.
*   **Configuration tampering**: Changes to critical system files or web directories.
*   **Network reconnaissance**: Port scans against your public IP.

The goal isn't to become a cybersecurity expert overnight, but to empower yourself with tools to understand and react to potential threats.

### Core Components of Our System

We'll focus on three main pillars:

1.  **Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS)**: Monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns.
2.  **Host-based Intrusion Detection (HIDS)**: Monitoring the system itself for unauthorized changes, processes, or activities.
3.  **Alerting**: Notifying you when something suspicious is detected.

For this guide, we'll assume a Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian or similar for package management).

### 1. Network Intrusion Detection with Suricata

[Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/) is a high-performance, open-source Network IDS/IPS/NSM engine. It can inspect network traffic using rules to identify known threats, policy violations, and anomalous activity.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install suricata
```

**Basic Configuration & Rule Management:**

Suricata uses a `suricata.yaml` configuration file (usually in `/etc/suricata/`) and relies on rule sets. The easiest way to get started with rules is by using `suricata-update`, which fetches and manages rules from various sources like Proofpoint Emerging Threats (ET) Open rules.

First, enable the ET Open rules source:

```bash
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/open
```

Then, update your rule sets:

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

```output
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- Loading /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- No such file or directory for /etc/suricata/etpro.yaml, skipping
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- Fetching https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-6.0.0/emerging.rules.tar.gz
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- Done.
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- Writing /var/lib/suricata/rules/suricata.rules
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- All rules successfully compiled.
2023-10-27 10:00:00 - <Info> -- Suricata-Update done.
```

**Running Suricata in IDS Mode:**

For a personal setup, running Suricata as an IDS (monitoring only) is generally safer than IPS (inline blocking), which can accidentally block legitimate traffic. We'll monitor a specific network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `enp0s3`).

Find your network interface name:

```bash
ip a
```

```output
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic enp0s3
       valid_lft 85600sec preferred_lft 85600sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fexx:xx:xx/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

In this example, `enp0s3` is our interface.

Now, run Suricata. For a personal system, you might run it in the foreground for testing, or as a service for continuous monitoring.

**Testing in Foreground (IDS mode):**

```bash
sudo suricata -i enp0s3 -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml --runmode autofp --set default-log-dir=/var/log/suricata/
```

This command starts Suricata on `enp0s3` using the default config, optimizes for auto-flow processing, and ensures logs go to `/var/log/suricata/`.

**Generating an Alert (Test):**

Let's try to trigger a simple alert. Suricata comes with rules to detect things like basic P2P traffic or well-known malware beaconing. A common test is to visit a known EICAR test file URL, though that might be blocked by your browser or AV.

A simpler test is to craft a custom rule to detect unique traffic. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, try to `nmap` scan your own machine from another device on the network (Suricata might detect port scanning activity if the rules are enabled).

Let's create a custom Suricata rule to detect a simple ICMP echo request (ping) with a specific payload, just for demonstration.
Create a file, e.g., `/etc/suricata/rules/local.rules`, and add:

```
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"LOCAL_RULE: ICMP Echo Request detected!"; content:"HelloSuricata"; nocase; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

Then, add `local.rules` to your `suricata.yaml` in the `rule-files` section (search for `rule-files:` and add `- local.rules` there). Make sure it's uncommented.

Reload Suricata rules:

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

Now, restart Suricata (or run it in the foreground again). From *another machine* on your network, try to ping your Suricata machine with a custom data payload:

```bash
ping -p "48656c6c6f5375726963617461" 192.168.1.100 # Replace with your IP
```
(Note: The payload `48656c6c6f5375726963617461` is the hex representation of `HelloSuricata`).

**Checking Suricata Logs:**

Suricata typically logs alerts to `eve.json` in `/var/log/suricata/`. You can tail this file.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/suricata/eve.json | grep LOCAL_RULE
```

```output
{"timestamp":"2023-10-27T10:05:30.123456+0000","flow_id":123456789,"in_iface":"enp0s3","event_type":"alert","src_ip":"192.168.1.101","dest_ip":"192.168.1.100","proto":"ICMP","icmp_type":8,"icmp_code":0,"alert":{"action":"allowed","gid":1,"signature_id":1000001,"rev":1,"signature":"LOCAL_RULE: ICMP Echo Request detected!","category":"Custom Local Rule","severity":3},"icmp":{"type":8,"code":0,"checksum":1234},"app_proto":"icmp","pkt_src":"wire","tx_id":0}
```

You'll see your custom alert, confirming Suricata is working. This JSON output is machine-readable and can be parsed by log management tools.

**Running as a Service:**

For continuous monitoring, enable and start the Suricata service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable suricata
sudo systemctl start suricata
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

```output

```

**Note:** Suricata can be resource-intensive on busy networks. For a personal workstation or home server, its impact is usually manageable. Regularly update rules using `sudo suricata-update` and consider running it via a `cron` job.

---

### 2. Host-Based Monitoring

Host-based detection focuses on what's happening *on* your machine itself.

#### 2.1 File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) with `inotifywait`

Detecting changes to critical system files or configuration files is vital. While robust FIM solutions like `AIDE` exist, `inotifywait` (part of `inotify-tools`) offers a simple, scriptable way to monitor specific paths in real-time.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install inotify-tools
```

**Basic Usage:**

To watch `/etc/passwd` for any write, attribute change, or delete operations:

```bash
inotifywait -m -e modify,attrib,create,delete,move /etc/passwd
```

```output
Setting up watches.
Watches established.
```

Now, open another terminal and modify `/etc/passwd` (e.g., add a comment, then remove it).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/passwd # Make a change, save, exit.
```

In the `inotifywait` terminal, you'll see:

```output
/etc/passwd MODIFY
/etc/passwd ATTRIB
```

**Scripting a Simple FIM:**

We can wrap `inotifywait` in a script to continuously monitor critical directories and log changes.

Create a script `monitor_files.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directories to monitor
WATCH_DIRS="/etc /var/www /root /home/$USER/.ssh"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/fim_events.log"
ALERT_EMAIL="your_email@example.com" # Replace with your email

echo "$(date): Starting FIM monitor..." | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

# Use inotifywait to monitor directories recursively
# -m: monitor indefinitely
# -r: recursive
# -e: events to watch for (create, delete, modify, attribute change, move)
# --format: custom output format
inotifywait -m -r -e create,delete,modify,attrib,move --format "%T %w%f %e" --timefmt "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" $WATCH_DIRS | \
while read DATE_TIME FILE_PATH EVENT; do
    LOG_ENTRY="File changed: $DATE_TIME - $FILE_PATH - Event: $EVENT"
    echo "$LOG_ENTRY" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

    # Simple Alerting (can be extended with ntfy.sh later)
    # Note: For production, avoid emailing on every change.
    # Implement rate-limiting or aggregate alerts.
    if [[ "$FILE_PATH" == *"/etc/sudoers"* || "$FILE_PATH" == *".ssh"* ]]; then
        echo "CRITICAL FIM ALERT: $LOG_ENTRY" | mail -s "CRITICAL FIM ALERT on $(hostname)" "$ALERT_EMAIL"
    fi
done
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x monitor_files.sh
```

Run it in the background:

```bash
./monitor_files.sh &
```

Now, try creating a file in `/etc`:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/test_file.tmp
```

Check `fim_events.log`:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/fim_events.log
```

```output
2023-10-27 10:30:00: Starting FIM monitor...
File changed: 2023-10-27 10:30:30 - /etc/test_file.tmp - Event: CREATE
```

**Note:** `inotifywait` is powerful but basic. It doesn't track file contents, only metadata and existence. For enterprise-grade FIM, look into solutions like `AIDE` (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) which creates a baseline database of file hashes and attributes and alerts on deviations. For a personal system, `inotifywait` provides quick, actionable insights.

#### 2.2 Rootkit Detection with `chkrootkit`

Rootkits are stealthy pieces of malware designed to hide their presence on a system. `chkrootkit` is a classic tool that checks for signs of rootkits by scanning system binaries for known patterns.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install chkrootkit
```

**Usage:**

Simply run `chkrootkit` with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo chkrootkit
```

```output
chkrootkit 0.53
Rootkit checks...
... (many checks) ...
Searching for Sniffers, last 100000 bytes... Nothing found
Searching for system-trojans in: /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /lib /lib64 /etc /usr/lib /usr/lib64
... (many checks) ...
chkproc: nothing detected
chklastlog: nothing detected
chkelf: nothing detected
chkdirs: nothing detected
```

If it detects something, it will output warnings or "INFECTED" messages. A clean output looks like the above.

**Automating with Cron:**

It's a good practice to run `chkrootkit` regularly. Schedule it with `cron`.

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run it daily at 3 AM and email the output:

```
0 3 * * * /usr/sbin/chkrootkit 2>&1 | mail -s "chkrootkit report for $(hostname)" your_email@example.com
```

**Note:** `chkrootkit` can produce false positives, especially on non-standard setups or if some binaries are locally compiled. Always verify any "infected" messages with other tools or research. It's also a signature-based tool, meaning it only finds *known* rootkits.

#### 2.3 Process and System Activity Monitoring with `auditd`

The Linux Audit Daemon (`auditd`) is a powerful framework for tracking security-relevant events on your system. It can log everything from file accesses to system calls, user logins, and privilege escalations.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install auditd audispd-plugins
```

**Basic Configuration - Adding Rules:**

Audit rules are defined in `/etc/audit/rules.d/`. It's best to create new files for your custom rules rather than modifying `audit.rules` directly. Rules are processed in order.

Let's add some common rules:

1.  **Monitor all `sudo` commands:**
    ```bash
    echo '-w /usr/bin/sudo -p xwa -k sudo_commands' | sudo tee /etc/audit/rules.d/sudo.rules
    ```
    *   `-w`: Watch a specific file or directory.
    *   `-p xwa`: Permissions (execute, write, attribute change).
    *   `-k`: Key to identify events in logs (makes searching easier).

2.  **Monitor failed login attempts:**
    ```bash
    echo '-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k faillog_changes' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/login_failures.rules
    echo '-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k lastlog_changes' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/login_failures.rules
    echo '-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F a2=O_RDWR|O_CREAT -F success=0 -F path=/var/log/auth.log -k auth_log_failures' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/login_failures.rules
    ```
    *   `openat` syscall, failed attempts (`success=0`) on `auth.log`.

3.  **Monitor sensitive configuration files (example):**
    ```bash
    echo '-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k sensitive_file_access' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/sensitive_files.rules
    echo '-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k sensitive_file_access' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/sensitive_files.rules
    echo '-w /etc/group -p wa -k sensitive_file_access' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/sensitive_files.rules
    echo '-w /etc/hostname -p wa -k sensitive_file_access' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/sensitive_files.rules
    echo '-w /etc/network/interfaces -p wa -k sensitive_file_access' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/sensitive_files.rules
    ```

After adding rules, reload the `auditd` configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

**Querying Audit Logs with `ausearch`:**

Audit logs are stored in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. Directly parsing this file is difficult due to its verbose format. Use `ausearch` to query the logs.

**Example 1: Search for `sudo` commands:**

```bash
sudo ausearch -k sudo_commands
```

Now, run a `sudo` command (e.g., `sudo ls /root`). Then re-run the `ausearch` command.

```output
----
time->Fri Oct 27 10:45:00 2023
type=PATH msg=audit(1698403500.123:123): item=0 name="/usr/bin/sudo" inode=123456 dev=fd:00 mode=0107555 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=NORMAL cap_fp=0000000000000000 cap_fi=0000000000000000 cap_fe=0 cap_fver=0
type=CWD msg=audit(1698403500.123:123): cwd="/home/youruser"
type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1698403500.123:123): arch=c000003e syscall=59 success=yes exit=0 a0=55e0c5112520 a1=55e0c5112580 a2=55e0c51125c0 a3=7ffd200b3e60 items=1 ppid=1234 pid=5678 auid=1000 uid=0 gid=0 euid=0 suid=0 fsuid=0 egid=0 sgid=0 fsgid=0 tty=pts/0 ses=1 comm="sudo" exe="/usr/bin/sudo" key="sudo_commands"
```
You can see the `comm="sudo"` and `key="sudo_commands"`.

**Example 2: Search for failed login attempts:**

Try to log in with a wrong password via SSH or locally.

```bash
sudo ausearch -k login_failures --raw | less # --raw for more details
```

**Note:** `auditd` generates a lot of logs. Be selective with your rules to avoid filling up disk space quickly, especially on busy systems. Review your rules regularly. For long-term storage and analysis, consider forwarding `auditd` logs to a centralized log management system (like a small Loki instance or even just a separate log host).

---

### 3. Simple Log Aggregation and Analysis

Most Linux systems centralize logs through `rsyslog` or `syslog-ng`. These are configured to collect logs from various sources (kernel, applications, authentication) and write them to files in `/var/log`.

For a personal setup, `grep` and its friends (`awk`, `sed`, `tail`) are your primary analysis tools.

**Common Logs to Check:**

*   `/var/log/auth.log` (or `secure` on RHEL/CentOS): Authentication attempts, sudo usage, SSH logins.
*   `/var/log/syslog` (or `messages`): General system activity, kernel messages.
*   `/var/log/kern.log`: Kernel-specific messages.
*   `/var/log/ufw.log` (if UFW firewall is enabled): Denied connections.
*   `/var/log/apache2/access.log` / `error.log` (if web server present): Web access and errors.

**Searching for Suspicious Patterns:**

1.  **Failed SSH login attempts:**

    ```bash
    grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 20
    ```

    ```output
    Oct 27 10:55:00 mymachine sshd[12345]: Failed password for invalid user visitor from 1.2.3.4 port 56789 ssh2
    Oct 27 10:55:01 mymachine sshd[12346]: Failed password for root from 1.2.3.5 port 56790 ssh2
    ```

2.  **Unusual `sudo` activity (beyond `auditd`):**

    ```bash
    grep "session opened for user root" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 20
    ```

    ```output
    Oct 27 10:56:00 mymachine sudo:    youruser : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/youruser ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/ls /root
    Oct 27 10:56:00 mymachine systemd-logind[987]: New session 123 of user root.
    ```

3.  **Connections denied by UFW:**

    ```bash
    grep "DENY" /var/log/ufw.log | tail -n 20
    ```

    ```output
    Oct 27 10:57:00 mymachine kernel: [12345.678901] [UFW AUDIT] IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd SRC=1.2.3.6 DST=192.168.1.100 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=50 ID=12345 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=56789 DPT=23 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 OPT (020405B401010402) MARK=0x8000 DENY IN=eth0 OUT= MAC= SRC=1.2.3.6 DST=192.168.1.100 LEN=40 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=245 ID=0 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=49876 DPT=3389 WINDOW=1024 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 OPT (020401BB0402080A000000000000000001030308) MARK=0x8000
    ```
    This shows attempts to connect to services like Telnet (port 23) and RDP (port 3389) that were denied.

### 4. Alerting System with `ntfy.sh`

Having logs is good, but getting *notified* is key. `ntfy.sh` (pronounced `notify`) is a simple, open-source push notification service. You can send messages to a topic, and any device subscribed to that topic receives the notification. It has Android and iOS apps, and a web interface.

**Note:** For personal use, the public `ntfy.sh` server is convenient. For maximum privacy and control, you can [self-host](https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/).

1.  **Install `ntfy` CLI client:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl # Ensure curl is installed
    sudo wget https://github.com/binwiederpur/ntfy/releases/download/v1.27.0/ntfy_1.27.0_linux_amd64.deb -O /tmp/ntfy.deb
    sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ntfy.deb
    ```
    (Check [ntfy.sh releases](https://github.com/binwiederpur/ntfy/releases) for the latest version if the above fails.)

2.  **Choose a topic:**
    Pick a unique, hard-to-guess topic name, e.g., `my_server_security_alerts_xyz123`.

3.  **Subscribe on your device:**
    Download the `ntfy` app (Android/iOS) and subscribe to your topic. Or, open `https://ntfy.sh/YOUR_TOPIC_NAME` in your browser.

4.  **Send a test notification from your server:**

    ```bash
    ntfy publish YOUR_TOPIC_NAME "Hello from your server's threat detection system!"
    ```

    ```output
    Published!
    ```

    You should immediately receive a notification on your subscribed device.

**Integrating with our scripts:**

Now, let's update our FIM script to send `ntfy` alerts.

Modify `monitor_files.sh` (replace the `mail` command):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ... (previous variables) ...
Ntfy_TOPIC="my_server_security_alerts_xyz123" # Replace with your ntfy topic

echo "$(date): Starting FIM monitor..." | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

inotifywait -m -r -e create,delete,modify,attrib,move --format "%T %w%f %e" --timefmt "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" $WATCH_DIRS | \
while read DATE_TIME FILE_PATH EVENT; do
    LOG_ENTRY="File changed: $DATE_TIME - $FILE_PATH - Event: $EVENT"
    echo "$LOG_ENTRY" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

    # Send ntfy alert for critical files
    if [[ "$FILE_PATH" == *"/etc/sudoers"* || "$FILE_PATH" == *".ssh"* ]]; then
        # Add a title and priority for ntfy
        ntfy publish -t "CRITICAL FIM ALERT on $(hostname)" -p high "$Ntfy_TOPIC" "CRITICAL: $LOG_ENTRY"
    fi
done
```

Restart your `monitor_files.sh` script. Now, if you modify `/etc/sudoers`, you'll get an `ntfy` alert.

You can extend this to other alerts:

**Alerting on failed SSH logins (e.g., if 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes):**

This requires a small script that parses `auth.log` periodically.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOG_FILE="/var/log/auth.log"
NTFY_TOPIC="my_server_security_alerts_xyz123"
LAST_CHECK_FILE="/var/tmp/last_ssh_check.txt"
THRESHOLD=5 # Number of failed attempts

# Get timestamp of last check, or default to 5 minutes ago
if [ -f "$LAST_CHECK_FILE" ]; then
    LAST_CHECK=$(cat "$LAST_CHECK_FILE")
else
    LAST_CHECK=$(date -d "5 minutes ago" +"%b %e %H:%M:%S")
fi

# Get current time for next check
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +"%b %e %H:%M:%S")

# Extract relevant log lines since last check
FAILED_ATTEMPTS=$(awk -v start_ts="$LAST_CHECK" -v end_ts="$CURRENT_TIME" '
    BEGIN { FS=" "; found_start=0 }
    {
        ts_log = sprintf("%s %s %s", $1, $2, $3);
        if (ts_log >= start_ts && !found_start) {
            found_start=1;
        }
        if (found_start && ts_log < end_ts && /Failed password/) {
            print;
        }
    }' "$LOG_FILE" | wc -l)

if [ "$FAILED_ATTEMPTS" -ge "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
    MESSAGE="Detected $FAILED_ATTEMPTS failed SSH login attempts since last check ($LAST_CHECK)."
    ntfy publish -t "High Number of Failed SSH Logins on $(hostname)" -p high "$NTFY_TOPIC" "$MESSAGE"
fi

# Update last check timestamp
echo "$CURRENT_TIME" > "$LAST_CHECK_FILE"
```

Save this as `check_ssh_failures.sh`, make it executable, and add it to `cron` to run every 5 minutes:

```bash
chmod +x check_ssh_failures.sh
crontab -e
```

Add:

```
*/5 * * * * /path/to/check_ssh_failures.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

**Note:** `ntfy.sh` is a great simple alerting solution. For more complex setups, you might consider Grafana Alerting, Prometheus Alertmanager, or even commercial services. But for personal use, this hits the sweet spot of ease of use and effectiveness.

### Limitations and Future Work

This personal threat detection system provides a solid foundation, but it's crucial to understand its limitations:

*   **False Positives**: Especially with generic Suricata rules or broad `auditd` rules, you'll encounter alerts that are legitimate activity. Fine-tuning is an ongoing process.
*   **Maintenance Overhead**: Rules need updating, logs need monitoring, and scripts might need tweaking. It's not a set-and-forget solution.
*   **Resource Usage**: Suricata and `auditd` can consume significant CPU and disk I/O on busy systems. Monitor their impact.
*   **Signature-Based**: Many of these tools rely on known signatures (rules, patterns). They might miss zero-day attacks or highly sophisticated threats.
*   **No Centralized Dashboard**: We're using CLI tools. For a visual overview, you'd need a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.
*   **No Incident Response**: This guide focuses purely on *detection*. A real system would include steps for analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.

**Ideas for Expansion:**

*   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Tools like `OpenVAS` or `Nuclei` can scan your systems for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Honeypots**: Deploying a simple honeypot (e.g., `cowrie` for SSH/Telnet, `tpot` for a full suite) can attract and log attacker activity.
*   **Centralized Logging**: Forward logs from multiple machines to a central server running `rsyslog` to `Elasticsearch/Loki/Splunk` for better aggregation, searching, and visualization.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Feed public threat intelligence lists (IPs, domains) into Suricata or your firewall to proactively block known bad actors.
*   **Automated Response**: For advanced users, implement scripts to automatically block IPs that trigger too many alerts via `ufw` or `fail2ban`. Be careful, this can lead to self-inflicted DoS!

### Conclusion

Building a personal threat detection system with open-source tools is a fantastic learning experience and a significant step towards securing your digital footprint. While not enterprise-grade, the combination of network-based IDS, host-based monitoring, and simple alerting gives you valuable visibility and early warning capabilities.

Start small, learn by doing, and gradually expand your system as your understanding grows. The open-source community provides an incredible array of tools; it's up to us to wield them effectively. Stay curious, stay secure!
