## How to Use ESP32 + MicroPython to Automate Anything

The world of IoT and automation is vast, but often intimidating due to its blend of hardware and software. Enter the ESP32, a remarkably versatile and inexpensive microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and MicroPython, a lean implementation of Python 3 optimized for microcontrollers. Together, they form an incredibly potent combination for rapid prototyping and deploying robust automation solutions.

This isn't a theoretical deep dive. This is a pragmatic, hands-on guide for developers who learn by doing. We'll start from scratch and build up to real-world examples, all from your command line.

## Why ESP32 + MicroPython?

*   **Python Simplicity**: Leverage your existing Python knowledge for embedded development. No complex C/C++ build systems, cryptic syntax, or obscure pointers.
*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Iterate quickly. Write code, upload, test. It's that fast.
*   **Connectivity Built-in**: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on a single, low-cost chip, opening doors to networked automation.
*   **Powerful Hardware**: Dual-core processor, ample RAM/Flash, and a rich peripheral set (ADC, DAC, I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, etc.).
*   **Cost-Effective**: ESP32 development boards are incredibly cheap, making experimentation accessible.

If you've ever wanted to control physical devices, read sensors, or build your own smart home gadgets without getting bogged down in low-level details, you're in the right place.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **ESP32 Development Board**: Any common board like the ESP32-WROOM-32 DevKitC, ESP32-S series, or NodeMCU-32S will work. Ensure it has a USB port for power and data.
2.  **USB A-to-Micro B or USB A-to-C Cable**: Depends on your ESP32 board. Crucially, it must be a *data cable*, not just a charging cable.
3.  **Python 3**: Installed on your host machine (Windows, macOS, Linux).
4.  **`pip`**: Python's package installer, usually bundled with Python 3.

## Step 1: Flashing MicroPython Firmware

The first order of business is to get MicroPython onto your ESP32. This process involves erasing the existing firmware and then writing the MicroPython `.bin` file. We'll use `esptool.py`, Espressif's official utility.

### 1.1 Install `esptool.py`

Open your terminal and install `esptool.py` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install esptool
```

```output
Collecting esptool
  Downloading esptool-4.7.0-py3-none-any.whl (124 kB)
     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 124.9/124.9 kB 5.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00
Collecting ecdsa<0.19.0,>=0.16.0 (from esptool)
  Downloading ecdsa-0.18.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (142 kB)
     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 142.1/142.1 kB 8.7 MB/s eta 0:00:00
... (other dependencies) ...
Successfully installed ecdsa-0.18.0 esptool-4.7.0 pyyaml-6.0.1
```

### 1.2 Download MicroPython Firmware

Head to the official MicroPython downloads page for ESP32: [micropython.org/download/esp32/](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/).
Download the latest stable `.bin` file (e.g., `esp32-20231026-v1.21.0.bin`). Place it in a convenient directory, like `~/Downloads/`.

### 1.3 Identify Your ESP32's Serial Port

Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via the USB cable.

*   **Linux**: Check `dmesg` or `ls /dev/tty*`. It will likely appear as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.
*   **macOS**: Check `ls /dev/cu.*`. It will often be `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX` or `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`.
*   **Windows**: Check Device Manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)". It will be `COMx` (e.g., `COM3`).

For the rest of this guide, I'll assume your port is `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Adjust accordingly.

### 1.4 Erase Flash

It's good practice to erase the entire flash memory before flashing new firmware. This prevents conflicts from previous installations.

```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
```

```output
esptool.py v4.7.0
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting...
Chip is ESP32-D0WDQ6 (revision 1)
Features: WiFi, BT, Dual Core, 240MHz, VRef calibration in efuse, Coding Scheme V1

Uploading stub...
Running stub...
Stub running...

```

**Note**: If `Connecting...` fails, try holding down the `BOOT` or `FLASH` button on your ESP32 board while executing the command, then release it once `Connecting...` appears. Some boards (especially older NodeMCU-32S) might require this.

### 1.5 Flash MicroPython Firmware

Now, flash the downloaded `.bin` file. Replace `esp32-latest.bin` with the actual filename and path to your downloaded firmware.

```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 ~/Downloads/esp32-latest.bin
```

We use `--baud 460800` for faster flashing, and `--flash_size=detect` to automatically determine your board's flash size. The `0` indicates the memory address where the firmware starts.

```output
esptool.py v4.7.0
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting...
Chip is ESP32-D0WDQ6 (revision 1)

```

Congratulations! Your ESP32 now runs MicroPython.

## Step 2: Interacting with the ESP32 - The REPL

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It's an interactive prompt, similar to Python on your computer, but running directly on the ESP32. This is your primary way to interact, test code, and debug on the device.

### 2.1 Connect via Serial Terminal

You'll need a serial terminal program.

*   **Linux**: `picocom` or `screen` (install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install picocom`).
*   **macOS**: `screen` is pre-installed.
*   **Windows**: PuTTY is a common choice, or use `pyserial` with a simple Python script. For command-line consistency, consider `minicom` if you use WSL, or follow the `ampy` examples which abstract away direct serial interaction once files are on the device. I'll use `picocom` for demonstration.

```bash
picocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Once connected, press `Ctrl+J` (Enter) a few times to get the `>>>` prompt. If nothing happens, press the `EN` (Enable/Reset) button on your ESP32 board.

```output
picocom v3.1

port is        : /dev/ttyUSB0
flow control   : none
baudrate is    : 115200
parity is      : none
databits are   : 8
stopbits are   : 1
escape is      : C-a
local echo is  : no
noinit is      : no
noreset is     : no
nolock is      : no
send_cmd is    : sz -vv
receive_cmd is : rz -vv -E
imap is        : 
omap is        : 
emap is        : crcrlf
logfile is     : none
initstring     : none
exitstring     : none
exit with C-x C-q, C-c C-x

Type C-a C-h for help.

>>> 
MicroPython v1.21.0 on 2023-10-26; ESP32 module with ESP32
Type "help()" for more information.
>>> 
```

**Common REPL Commands:**

*   `help()`: Get general help.
*   `help('modules')`: List available built-in modules.
*   `import machine`: Import the core hardware control module.
*   `dir(machine)`: See what functions/classes are available in the `machine` module.
*   `Ctrl+D`: Soft reboot the ESP32. This re-runs `boot.py` and `main.py` if they exist.
*   `Ctrl+C`: Interrupt a running script.
*   `Ctrl+X`: Exit `picocom`.

### 2.2 Blink an LED (Hello World of Embedded)

Let's make the onboard LED blink. Most ESP32 boards have an LED connected to GPIO2.

```python
>>> from machine import Pin
>>> led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
>>> led.value(1) # Turn LED ON (or OFF, depending on board's wiring - active high/low)
>>> led.value(0) # Turn LED OFF (or ON)
```

To make it blink repeatedly:

```python
>>> import time
>>> from machine import Pin
>>> 
>>> led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
>>> 
>>> while True:
...     led.value(not led.value())
...     time.sleep(0.5)
... 
```

To stop this, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Step 3: Transferring Files with `ampy`

Typing code directly into the REPL is fine for testing, but impractical for larger scripts. We need a way to transfer files from our computer to the ESP32's filesystem. `ampy` (Adafruit MicroPython Tool) is an excellent choice.

### 3.1 Install `ampy`

```bash
pip install adafruit-ampy
```

```output
Collecting adafruit-ampy
  Downloading adafruit_ampy-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (16 kB)
... (dependencies) ...
Successfully installed adafruit-ampy-1.0.1 click-8.1.7 pyserial-3.5
```

### 3.2 Basic `ampy` Commands

Ensure your serial terminal program (like `picocom`) is *not* connected to the ESP32 when using `ampy`, as `ampy` needs exclusive access to the serial port.

*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 ls`: List files on the ESP32.
*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put <local_file> [remote_file]`: Upload a file.
*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 get <remote_file> [local_file]`: Download a file.
*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 rm <remote_file>`: Delete a file.
*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 run <local_script>`: Run a local script on the ESP32 without saving it permanently.
*   `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 reset`: Soft reset the board.

Let's put our LED blink script into `main.py`. MicroPython automatically runs `boot.py` (for setup) and then `main.py` (your main application code) on startup or soft reboot.

Create a file named `main.py` on your computer:

```python
# main.py
import time
from machine import Pin

# Pin 2 is often the onboard LED on ESP32 DevKits
# Check your board's schematic if it's different
led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)

print("Starting LED blinker...")

try:
    while True:
        led.value(not led.value())
        print(f"LED is now {'ON' if led.value() else 'OFF'}")
        time.sleep(1) # Blink every 1 second
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script interrupted.")
    led.value(0) # Ensure LED is off on exit
```

Now, upload it:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put main.py
```

```output
Uploading main.py to /main.py...
```

After uploading, soft reset the ESP32 to run `main.py`:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 reset
```

```output
Soft resetting...
```

Now, re-connect with your serial terminal (e.g., `picocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`) to see the output.

```output
>>> 
MicroPython v1.21.0 on 2023-10-26; ESP32 module with ESP32
Type "help()" for more information.
>>> Starting LED blinker...
LED is now ON
LED is now OFF
LED is now ON
LED is now OFF
...
```

You can now disconnect the terminal, and the ESP32 will continue blinking the LED as long as it's powered. This is the foundation of automated tasks.

## Step 4: Networking with MicroPython (Wi-Fi)

The ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi is a game-changer for automation, allowing your devices to connect to the internet, communicate with other devices, or host web interfaces.

### 4.1 Connecting to Wi-Fi

The `network` module handles Wi-Fi. It's often best to put Wi-Fi connection logic in `boot.py` so that `main.py` can assume connectivity.

Create a `boot.py` file on your computer:

```python
# boot.py
import esp
import gc
import network
import time

# Disable debug output to save memory and reduce noise
esp.osdebug(None)
gc.collect()

# Your Wi-Fi credentials
SSID = 'YOUR_WIFI_SSID'
PASSWORD = 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD'

print(f"Connecting to WiFi: {SSID}...")

sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta_if.active(True)
sta_if.connect(SSID, PASSWORD)

max_attempts = 10
for i in range(max_attempts):
    if sta_if.isconnected():
        print("WiFi connected!")
        print('Network config:', sta_if.ifconfig())
        break
    print(f"Attempt {i+1}/{max_attempts}: Waiting for WiFi connection...")
    time.sleep(1)
else:
    print("Failed to connect to WiFi after multiple attempts.")
    # Consider adding fallback logic or rebooting here
    # machine.reset() # Uncomment to reset if connection fails

# Ensure the AP interface is disabled if not needed, saves memory
ap_if = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF)
ap_if.active(False)

print("Boot script finished.")
```

**Replace `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` and `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` with your actual Wi-Fi credentials.**

Upload `boot.py`:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put boot.py
```

```output
Uploading boot.py to /boot.py...
```

Now, reset the ESP32 and connect to the serial terminal to observe the connection process:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 reset
picocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

```output
Soft resetting...
Connecting to WiFi: MyHomeNetwork...
Attempt 1/10: Waiting for WiFi connection...
Attempt 2/10: Waiting for WiFi connection...
WiFi connected!
Network config: ('192.168.1.100', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.1')
Boot script finished.
>>> Starting LED blinker...
LED is now ON
...
```

You now have a connected ESP32!

### 4.2 Hosting a Simple Web Server

Let's build a tiny web server on the ESP32 to control the LED. This demonstrates how your ESP32 can act as a local control point.

Modify your `main.py` (after `boot.py` ensures connection):

```python
# main.py
import time
from machine import Pin
import socket # For networking
import network # To check if connected

# Pin 2 is often the onboard LED on ESP32 DevKits
led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
led_state = "OFF" # Keep track of the LED state

# Basic HTML page for controlling the LED
def web_page():
    html = """<!DOCTYPE html>

    return html

# Check if connected to Wi-Fi before starting the server
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
if not sta_if.isconnected():
    print("WiFi not connected. Web server will not start.")
else:
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(('', 80)) # Bind to port 80 (HTTP)
    s.listen(5) # Listen for up to 5 connections

    print(f"Web server active on http://{sta_if.ifconfig()[0]}/")

    while True:
        try:
            conn, addr = s.accept()
            print('Got a connection from %s' % str(addr))
            request = conn.recv(1024)
            request = str(request)
            print('Content = %s' % request)

            # Parse request to find 'led=on' or 'led=off'
            led_on = request.find('/?led=on')
            led_off = request.find('/?led=off')

            if led_on == 6: # Index 6 means it's the main path
                led.value(1)
                led_state = "ON"
            if led_off == 6:
                led.value(0)
                led_state = "OFF"

            response = web_page()
            conn.send('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n')
            conn.send('Content-Type: text/html\n')
            conn.send('Connection: close\n\n')
            conn.sendall(response)
            conn.close()
        except OSError as e:
            conn.close()
            print('Connection error:', e)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Web server stopped by user.")
            led.value(0) # Ensure LED is off
            break

```

Upload the updated `main.py`:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put main.py
```

```output
Uploading main.py to /main.py...
```

Reset the ESP32:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 reset
```

Now, check your serial output (`picocom`) for the IP address. Open a web browser on your computer and navigate to `http://<YOUR_ESP32_IP_ADDRESS>/`. You should see a simple page with ON/OFF buttons for the LED.

This is a powerful concept: your ESP32 can be a tiny server providing control over its attached hardware.

## Step 5: Automating I/O - Sensors and Actuators

The `machine` module is your interface to the ESP32's hardware peripherals.

### 5.1 Digital Input (Button) and Output (LED)

Let's combine a physical button with an LED. When you press the button, the LED state flips.

**Hardware Setup**:
*   Connect an LED (with a 220-330 ohm resistor in series) between GPIO16 and GND (short leg of LED).
*   Connect a push button between GPIO17 and GND. Use the internal pull-up resistor on GPIO17.

Update `main.py`:

```python
# main.py
import time
from machine import Pin

# Define pins
LED_PIN = 16 # Example: Connect LED (with resistor) to GPIO16
BUTTON_PIN = 17 # Example: Connect push button to GPIO17

led = Pin(LED_PIN, Pin.OUT)
# Configure button with internal PULL_UP resistor.
# When pressed, it connects to GND, so its value becomes 0.
button = Pin(BUTTON_PIN, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

print("Monitoring button press...")

# Initial state for the LED
current_led_state = 0 # Off
led.value(current_led_state)

last_button_state = button.value()
debounce_time_ms = 50 # milliseconds for debounce

try:
    while True:
        # Read current button state
        new_button_state = button.value()

        # Check for state change (button pressed - going from HIGH to LOW)
        if new_button_state != last_button_state:
            # Simple debounce: wait a bit and re-read
            time.sleep_ms(debounce_time_ms)
            if new_button_state == button.value(): # Check if still changed
                if new_button_state == 0: # Button pressed (active low)
                    current_led_state = 1 - current_led_state # Toggle state
                    led.value(current_led_state)
                    print(f"Button pressed! LED is now {'ON' if current_led_state else 'OFF'}")
        
        last_button_state = new_button_state
        time.sleep_ms(10) # Small delay to avoid busy-waiting too much
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script interrupted.")
    led.value(0) # Ensure LED is off
```

Upload and reset. Press the button, and the LED should toggle.

### 5.2 Analog Input (LDR Light Sensor)

The ESP32 has an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read analog voltages, perfect for sensors like an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or potentiometer.

**Hardware Setup**:
*   Connect an LDR in a voltage divider circuit.
    *   One side of LDR to 3.3V.
    *   The other side of LDR to a 10k Ohm resistor.
    *   The other side of the 10k Ohm resistor to GND.
    *   The point *between* the LDR and the 10k Ohm resistor connects to an ADC pin (e.g., GPIO34, GPIO35, GPIO36). These pins are input-only.
*   Let's use `GPIO34`.

Modify `main.py`:

```python
# main.py
import time
from machine import ADC, Pin

# ADC pin for LDR (e.g., GPIO34)
# Note: On some ESP32 boards, specific ADC pins are available.
# Common ones are GPIO32-39. GPIO34 is a good choice as it's input-only.
LDR_PIN = 34
adc = ADC(Pin(LDR_PIN))

# Set attenuation to increase voltage range (0-3.3V)
# ADC.ATTN_0DB: 0-1.0V
# ADC.ATTN_2_5DB: 0-1.25V
# ADC.ATTN_6DB: 0-1.5V
# ADC.ATTN_11DB: 0-3.3V (Recommended for full range)
adc.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)

# Set resolution (e.g., 12-bit for 0-4095 range)
adc.width(ADC.WIDTH_12BIT)

print("Reading LDR sensor values...")

try:
    while True:
        ldr_value = adc.read() # Read raw ADC value (0-4095 for 12-bit)
        print(f"LDR Raw Value: {ldr_value}")

        # You can map this to a more meaningful value (e.g., light intensity)
        # For example, if 0 is max light and 4095 is min light:
        light_intensity = round((1 - (ldr_value / 4095)) * 100, 2)
        print(f"Estimated Light Intensity: {light_intensity}%")

        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script interrupted.")
```

Upload, reset, and observe. Cover the LDR, and you should see the `LDR Raw Value` change significantly.

### 5.3 I2C Communication (BMP280 Temperature/Pressure Sensor)

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a common serial communication protocol for connecting multiple low-speed peripheral devices to a microcontroller. Most sensors use it.

**Hardware Setup**:
*   **BMP280 Module**:
    *   VCC -> 3.3V (ESP32)
    *   GND -> GND (ESP32)
    *   SDA -> GPIO21 (ESP32)
    *   SCL -> GPIO22 (ESP32)

First, let's write a simple I2C scanner to ensure the sensor is detected. MicroPython typically uses GPIO22 for SCL and GPIO21 for SDA by default for I2C.

```python
# i2c_scanner.py
from machine import Pin, I2C
import time

# I2C bus setup (default pins for ESP32)
# SDA: GPIO21, SCL: GPIO22
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21), freq=400000)

print('I2C scan started...')
devices = i2c.scan()

if devices:
    print('I2C devices found:', len(devices))
    for device in devices:
        print("Hex address: ", hex(device))
else:
    print('No I2C devices found.')

```

Upload and run this script temporarily:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put i2c_scanner.py
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 run i2c_scanner.py
```

```output
I2C scan started...
I2C devices found: 1
Hex address:  0x76
```

The BMP280 typically has an I2C address of `0x76` or `0x77`. If you see one of these, your wiring is correct.

Now, for the actual sensor reading, we'll need a driver. MicroPython's `micropython-lib` repository often has pure Python drivers. For BMP280, there's `bmp280.py`.

Download `bmp280.py` from [micropython-lib](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/drivers/sensor/bmp280/bmp280.py) (or copy its content into a file). Place it in the same directory as your `main.py`.

Upload `bmp280.py` to the ESP32:

```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put bmp280.py
```

Now, modify `main.py` to use the BMP280:

```python
# main.py
import time
from machine import Pin, I2C
from bmp280 import BMP280 # Import the driver

# I2C bus setup
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21), freq=400000)

# Check if BMP280 is present at its common addresses
try:
    sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x76) # Try common address 0x76
    print("BMP280 sensor initialized (address 0x76).")
except OSError:
    try:
        sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x77) # Try common address 0x77
        print("BMP280 sensor initialized (address 0x77).")
    except OSError:
        print("BMP280 sensor not found at 0x76 or 0x77. Check wiring/address.")
        sensor = None # Set sensor to None if not found

if sensor:
    print("Reading BMP280 sensor values...")
    try:
        while True:
            temperature = sensor.temperature # Reads in Celsius
            pressure = sensor.pressure / 100 # Reads in Pascals, convert to hPa/mbar
            
            print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} C")
            print(f"Pressure: {pressure:.2f} hPa")
            
            time.sleep(5) # Read every 5 seconds
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Script interrupted.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during sensor reading: {e}")
```

Upload and reset. You should see temperature and pressure readings in your serial terminal.

## Step 6: Beyond Basics - Timers and Deep Sleep

For more sophisticated automation, you'll need to manage tasks efficiently and save power.

### 6.1 `machine.Timer` for Non-Blocking Periodic Tasks

Instead of `time.sleep()`, which blocks the entire program, `machine.Timer` allows you to schedule functions to run periodically without blocking the main loop. This is crucial for applications that need to respond to multiple events (e.g., web requests *and* sensor readings).

```python
# main.py (Example with Timer)
from machine import Pin, Timer
import time

led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
timer0 = Timer(0) # Create a timer object

def toggle_led(timer):
    """Callback function to toggle the LED."""
    led.value(not led.value())
    print(f"LED toggled by timer. Current state: {'ON' if led.value() else 'OFF'}")

print("Starting LED blinker with Timer...")

# Initialize timer to call toggle_led every 1000ms (1 second)
# mode=Timer.PERIODIC means it will repeat
# callback=toggle_led is the function to call
timer0.init(period=1000, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=toggle_led)

try:
    # The main loop can now do other things or just sleep
    while True:
        # This loop continues to run, allowing the web server or other tasks to operate
        # The timer callback happens in the background.
        print("Main loop running...")
        time.sleep(5) # Simulate other work
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script interrupted. De-initializing timer.")
    timer0.deinit() # Stop the timer
    led.value(0) # Ensure LED is off
```

Upload and reset. You'll see "LED toggled by timer" messages alongside "Main loop running...", demonstrating non-blocking execution.

### 6.2 `machine.deepsleep` for Power Efficiency

For battery-powered IoT devices, `deepsleep` is critical. It turns off most of the ESP32's components, reducing power consumption drastically. The device wakes up after a specified time or external interrupt, runs `boot.py` and `main.py` again, and then goes back to sleep.

```python
# main.py (Example with Deep Sleep)
import machine
import time

# Pin for a dummy "sensor" (e.g., LDR or button) that wakes up the device
# Configure wake-up source. For timer, no external pin needed.
# For external wake-up, connect a switch to a specific GPIO and GND.
# Example: Use GPIO32 for external wake-up
# wake_pin = machine.Pin(32, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP)
# machine.wake_reason() will tell you how it woke up.

sleep_duration_seconds = 10

print(f"Going into deep sleep for {sleep_duration_seconds} seconds...")

# Optional: Print wake reason (only valid after a deep sleep wake-up)
# This will be `None` on first boot after power-up/reset
wake_reason = machine.wake_reason()
if wake_reason == machine.DEEPSLEEP_RESET:
    print("Woke up from deep sleep (timer or external pin).")
elif wake_reason == machine.EXT0_RESET:
    print("Woke up from deep sleep (external pin 0).")
elif wake_reason == machine.EXT1_RESET:
    print("Woke up from deep sleep (external pin 1).")
elif wake_reason == machine.PWRON_RESET:
    print("Woke up from power-on reset.")
else:
    print(f"Woke up from: {wake_reason}") # Other reset types

# Before sleeping, perform any tasks (e.g., read sensors, send data)
# For demonstration, toggle an LED briefly to show activity
led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)
led.value(1)
time.sleep(0.1)
led.value(0)
time.sleep(0.1)
led.value(1)
time.sleep(0.1)
led.value(0) # Ensure LED is off before deep sleep

# Set up timer for deep sleep
machine.deepsleep(sleep_duration_seconds * 1000) # Argument is in milliseconds

# Code after deepsleep() will not be executed unless wake-up fails
print("This line will not be printed if deep sleep successful.")
```

Upload and reset. You'll see the print statements, a quick LED blink, then silence for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the ESP32 will reboot and the cycle repeats. This is ideal for battery-powered sensor nodes.

## Step 7: Practical Automation Examples

Let's put it all together into more complete scenarios.

### 7.1 Sending Sensor Data to a Cloud Service (HTTP POST)

Many cloud services (like Adafruit IO, ThingSpeak, or your custom API) accept data via HTTP POST. We'll use `urequests` (MicroPython's equivalent of `requests`) to send our BMP280 data.

First, you might need to install `urequests` on your ESP32 if it's not pre-installed with your firmware.

```bash
# This is typically not needed for recent firmware, but good to know
# It pulls from micropython-lib if the module is not already on your board
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put lib/urequests.py /urequests.py 
# If urequests is not directly available, you might need to find a simpler HTTP client
# Or download urequests.py manually and upload it.
```
**Note**: Some MicroPython firmwares come with `urequests` pre-compiled as a built-in module, accessible via `import urequests`. If `ampy put` doesn't work directly from a `lib` path, you can manually download `urequests.py` from the micropython-lib repo and upload it to the root of your ESP32's filesystem.

`urequests` is a simplified version of `requests`, useful for basic HTTP client needs.

Now, modify your `main.py` to read BMP280 and POST data. We'll use `httpbin.org/post` as a dummy endpoint to see the request. For a real application, you'd use your specific API endpoint.

```python
# main.py
import time
import urequests # For HTTP requests
from machine import Pin, I2C
from bmp280 import BMP280 # Assuming bmp280.py is on your board
import network

# --- Sensor Setup (from previous example) ---
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21), freq=400000)
try:
    sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x76)
except OSError:
    try:
        sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x77)
    except OSError:
        print("BMP280 sensor not found.")
        sensor = None

# --- Cloud Service Configuration ---
# Replace with your actual API endpoint
# For testing, httpbin.org/post will echo your POST data back
API_URL = "http://httpbin.org/post" 
# Example for Adafruit IO (replace with your AIO_USERNAME, AIO_KEY, FEED_NAME)
# API_URL = "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{AIO_USERNAME}/feeds/{FEED_NAME}/data"
# HEADERS = {'X-AIO-Key': '{AIO_KEY}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'} # Example headers

# Check if connected to Wi-Fi
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
if not sta_if.isconnected():
    print("WiFi not connected. Cannot send data.")
    while True:
        time.sleep(5) # Loop indefinitely if no WiFi
else:
    print(f"Connected to WiFi. Sending data to {API_URL}...")

try:
    while True:
        if sensor:
            temperature = sensor.temperature
            pressure = sensor.pressure / 100 # hPa

            print(f"Reading: Temp={temperature:.2f}C, Pressure={pressure:.2f}hPa")

            # Prepare data payload (JSON is common)
            data_payload = {
                "temperature": round(temperature, 2),
                "pressure": round(pressure, 2),
                "device_id": "esp32-sensor-001" # Unique ID for your device
            }
            
            try:
                # Send HTTP POST request
                # For basic httpbin.org, a simple JSON payload without custom headers is fine
                response = urequests.post(API_URL, json=data_payload)
                # If you need custom headers for a service like Adafruit IO:
                # response = urequests.post(API_URL, json=data_payload, headers=HEADERS)

                print(f"HTTP POST Status: {response.status_code}")
                # print(f"HTTP POST Response: {response.text}") # Uncomment to see full response
                response.close() # Important to close the response object to free memory

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to send data via HTTP POST: {e}")
        else:
            print("Sensor not initialized, skipping data send.")

        time.sleep(30) # Send data every 30 seconds
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script interrupted.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unhandled error occurred: {e}")

```

Upload `main.py` and `bmp280.py` (if you haven't already), then reset. Observe the serial output. You should see successful POST requests. If you use `httpbin.org/post`, you can paste the URL into your browser to see the data your ESP32 sent.

### 7.2 MQTT Client for Pub/Sub Automation

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol perfect for IoT. It uses a publish/subscribe model, ideal for event-driven automation.

We'll use `umqtt.simple` (often built-in or easily available). We'll connect to a public MQTT broker (e.g., `broker.hivemq.com`) and publish sensor data, and also subscribe to a topic to control an LED.

**Hardware**: Same LED (GPIO2) and BMP280 setup as before.

```python
# main.py (MQTT example)
import time
from machine import Pin, I2C
import network
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient # MicroPython MQTT client
from bmp280 import BMP280 # Assuming bmp280.py is on your board

# --- MQTT Configuration ---
MQTT_BROKER = "broker.hivemq.com" # Public broker for testing
MQTT_PORT = 1883
CLIENT_ID = b"esp32_sensor_001" # Unique client ID, must be bytes
# Topic to publish sensor data
PUBLISH_TOPIC = b"esp32/home/sensor/data"
# Topic to subscribe to for control commands
SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC = b"esp32/home/led/control"

# --- Hardware Setup ---
led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
led.value(0) # Start with LED off

i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21), freq=400000)
try:
    sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x76)
except OSError:
    try:
        sensor = BMP280(i2c, addr=0x77)
    except OSError:
        print("BMP280 sensor not found.")
        sensor = None

# --- MQTT Callback Function ---
def mqtt_callback(topic, msg):
    """Called when a message is received on a subscribed topic."""
    print(f"Received MQTT message on topic '{topic.decode()}': {msg.decode()}")
    if topic == SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC:
        if msg == b"on":
            led.value(1)
            print("LED turned ON by MQTT.")
        elif msg == b"off":
            led.value(0)
            print("LED turned OFF by MQTT.")
        else:
            print("Unknown LED command.")

# --- MQTT Connection ---
def connect_mqtt():
    sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    if not sta_if.isconnected():
        print("WiFi not connected. Cannot connect to MQTT.")
        return None

    try:
        client = MQTTClient(CLIENT_ID, MQTT_BROKER, port=MQTT_PORT)
        client.set_callback(mqtt_callback) # Set the message callback
        client.connect()
        client.subscribe(SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC) # Subscribe to LED control topic
        print(f"Connected to MQTT broker: {MQTT_BROKER}")
        print(f"Subscribed to topic: {SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC.decode()}")
        return client
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect to MQTT broker: {e}")
        return None

# Main loop
client = None
last_publish_time = time.time()
publish_interval_seconds = 10

while True:
    if client is None:
        client = connect_mqtt()
        if client is None:
            time.sleep(5) # Wait before retrying connection
            continue

    try:
        client.check_msg() # Check for new messages from MQTT broker (non-blocking)

        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - last_publish_time >= publish_interval_seconds:
            if sensor:
                temperature = sensor.temperature
                pressure = sensor.pressure / 100
                payload = f'{{"temperature": {temperature:.2f}, "pressure": {pressure:.2f}}}'
                print(f"Publishing: {payload} to {PUBLISH_TOPIC.decode()}")
                client.publish(PUBLISH_TOPIC, payload.encode())
            else:
                print("Sensor not initialized, skipping publish.")
            last_publish_time = current_time

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"MQTT error: {e}. Reconnecting...")
        client.disconnect()
        client = None # Force re-connection on next loop
    
    time.sleep(1) # Small delay to prevent busy-looping
```

Upload `main.py` and `bmp280.py` (and `umqtt/simple.py` if not built-in). Reset.

**Testing:**
1.  **Publishing**: Observe the serial output. Every 10 seconds, you should see the ESP32 publishing sensor data to `esp32/home/sensor/data`. You can use an MQTT client (like `mqtt-explorer` or `mosquitto_pub` CLI) to subscribe to this topic and see the data.
    ```bash
    mosquitto_sub -h broker.hivemq.com -t esp32/home/sensor/data
    ```
2.  **Subscribing/Controlling**: Use an MQTT client to publish to `esp32/home/led/control`.
    To turn LED ON:
    ```bash
    mosquitto_pub -h broker.hivemq.com -t esp32/home/led/control -m "on"
    ```
    To turn LED OFF:
    ```bash
    mosquitto_pub -h broker.hivemq.com -t esp32/home/led/control -m "off"
    ```
    The LED on your ESP32 should respond, and you'll see messages in your serial terminal.

This bidirectional communication is the essence of powerful IoT automation.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

*   **Error Handling**: Always use `try...except` blocks for network operations, sensor readings, and file I/O. Connections can drop, sensors can fail.
*   **Memory Management**: MicroPython is lean, but the ESP32 still has limited RAM.
    *   Use `gc.collect()` periodically, especially after large operations, to free up memory.
    *   Avoid creating large data structures or long strings.
    *   Use `urequests` for HTTP, `umqtt` for MQTT. Prefer `ujson`, `ustruct`, etc., over full `json`, `struct` where possible.
    *   Print messages sparingly in production code to save memory (and CPU cycles).
    *   Consider `esp.osdebug(None)` in `boot.py` to disable verbose debug output from the ESP-IDF layer, freeing up memory.
*   **`boot.py` vs. `main.py`**:
    *   `boot.py`: Runs immediately on power-up/reset. Use for network configuration (Wi-Fi), setting up common libraries, or initial hardware configuration. It should be minimal and robust.
    *   `main.py`: Your main application logic.
*   **`ampy` vs. `webrepl`**: For basic file transfer, `ampy` is straightforward. For advanced interaction *over Wi-Fi* (without a USB cable), `webrepl` is an option. It's more complex to set up but powerful. For beginners, `ampy` is simpler.
*   **Power Cycling**: If your ESP32 becomes unresponsive (e.g., due to an infinite loop without `KeyboardInterrupt`), simply remove and re-apply power.
*   **Serial Port Issues**: If `esptool.py` or `ampy` fail to connect:
    *   Ensure no other program (like `picocom`) is using the serial port.
    *   Double-check the correct `/dev/tty...` or `COMx` path.
    *   Try holding the `BOOT`/`FLASH` button while plugging in or running the command, then release.
*   **"Out of memory" Errors**: Simplify your code, reduce variable usage, use smaller data types where possible, or optimize libraries you're using. `gc.collect()` might help, but fundamental re-architecting might be needed.
*   **Firmware Updates**: Occasionally update your MicroPython firmware for bug fixes, new features, and performance improvements. Follow the flashing steps again.

## Conclusion

You've now got the tools and knowledge to wield the ESP32 and MicroPython for a vast array of automation projects. From blinking an LED to reading sensors, hosting web servers, and communicating via MQTT, you've seen how to connect the physical world to the digital realm with concise, readable Python code.

The power lies in combining these concepts. Imagine a battery-powered sensor sending temperature and humidity data via MQTT every hour (using deep sleep), while also providing a local web interface for diagnostics. Or a smart light switch controlled by a button, a web interface, and an MQTT command.

Start small, build by example, and iterate. The ESP32 and MicroPython democratize embedded systems, putting powerful automation capabilities directly into the hands of developers. Go forth and automate anything!

```
**Self-Correction/Reflection during the process:**

*   Initially thought about including a full `webrepl` setup, but decided against it to keep the focus on command-line simplicity and avoid overcomplicating for a beginner. `ampy` is sufficient for file transfer. Mentioned `webrepl` as an alternative.
*   For the HTTP POST example, instead of a specific cloud provider (which would require API keys and setup), opted for `httpbin.org/post` to demonstrate the POST request and response, which is more universal and easier to test without external accounts. Added comments for how it might look for Adafruit IO.
*   For the I2C sensor, ensured to include the I2C scanner first. This is a crucial troubleshooting step that beginners often miss.
*   Emphasized `boot.py` for Wi-Fi setup and `main.py` for the main application, which is a standard and robust pattern.
*   Made sure to include `response.close()` for `urequests` as it's a common memory leak source if forgotten on constrained devices.
*   Added `try...except` around major loops and network operations to emphasize robust coding, a must for unattended automation.
*   Reiterated the importance of `time.sleep_ms` vs `time.sleep` and `machine.Timer` for non-blocking operations.
*   Added `gc.collect()` and `esp.osdebug(None)` as crucial memory-saving tips.
*   Ensured all code blocks have language specifiers (e.g., `python`, `bash`, `output`).
*   The "Automate Anything" claim is ambitious, but the examples (sensor reading, web control, MQTT, deep sleep) cover the fundamental building blocks that, when combined, truly enable a vast range of automation possibilities. The post focuses on the *how-to* of these building blocks.
