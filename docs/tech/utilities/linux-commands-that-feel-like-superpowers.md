## 1. `grep` & The Art of Text Discovery

At its core, `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) is about searching for patterns in text. Simple, right? But the true power of `grep` lies in its versatility and speed, making it indispensable for debugging, log analysis, and code exploration.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Imagine sifting through gigabytes of log files for a specific error message, finding a particular function across an entire codebase, or just quickly checking if a configuration file has a certain setting. `grep` does this with blinding speed, using regular expressions to define precise search patterns. It's the ultimate forensic tool for text.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Basic Search:** Find all lines containing "error" in `syslog`.
    ```bash
    grep "error" /var/log/syslog
    ```
*   **Case-insensitive Search:** Ignore case when searching for "warning".
    ```bash
    grep -i "warning" /var/log/auth.log
    ```
*   **Recursive Search (Codebase):** Find "main_function" in all `.c` files within the current directory and its subdirectories, showing line numbers.
    ```bash
    grep -rni "main_function" . --include=\*.c
    ```
*   **Invert Match:** Show lines that *do not* contain "info".
    ```bash
    grep -v "info" application.log
    ```
*   **Contextual Search:** Show 3 lines before and after a match.
    ```bash
    grep -C 3 "critical_error" debug.log
    ```

**Advanced Tips/Combinations:**

*   Combine `grep` with `ps` to find processes: `ps aux | grep "nginx"`.
*   Pipe `find` results to `grep`: `find . -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 grep "keyword"`.
*   **Modern Alternative: `ripgrep` (or `rg`)**. While `grep` is a classic, `ripgrep` is a newer, incredibly fast alternative built on Rust. It's often much quicker for large codebases and has smarter defaults for things like respecting `.gitignore`. If you're doing a lot of code searching, `rg` is a significant upgrade.

## 2. `awk` & `sed`: The Text Transformers

While `grep` finds text, `awk` and `sed` are about *transforming* it. They are miniature programming languages designed for powerful text manipulation, essential for parsing logs, reformatting data, and automating file edits.

### 2.1. `awk`: The Data Extractor & Reporter

`awk` is a pattern-scanning and processing language. It processes text line by line, splitting each line into fields, and then allows you to perform operations based on patterns found and actions defined.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Think of `awk` as a spreadsheet processor for the command line. You can extract specific columns, sum values, calculate averages, and even generate reports from unstructured text data. It's invaluable for turning raw log entries into meaningful insights or quickly reformatting CSV-like data.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Print Specific Fields:** Show username and home directory from `/etc/passwd`. (Fields are usually space or colon-separated by default).
    ```bash
    awk -F ':' '{print $1, $6}' /etc/passwd
    ```
    *   `-F ':'` sets the field separator to a colon. `$1` refers to the first field, `$6` to the sixth.
*   **Filter and Print:** Show processes using more than 10% CPU from `top` output.
    ```bash
    top -bn1 | awk 'NR>7 {if ($9 > 10) print $0}'
    ```
    *   `NR>7` skips the header lines. `$9` typically represents CPU usage.
*   **Calculate Sum:** Sum the sizes of files in a directory (assuming `ls -l` output).
    ```bash
    ls -l | awk '{sum += $5} END {print "Total size:", sum/1024/1024, "MB"}'
    ```
    *   `sum += $5` adds the 5th field (file size) to `sum`. `END` block executes after all lines are processed.

**Advanced Tips:** `awk` supports variables, arrays, control flow (if/else, loops), and built-in functions, making it a surprisingly complete scripting language for text.
*   [GNU Awk User's Guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html)

### 2.2. `sed`: The Stream Editor

`sed` (Stream EDitor) is primarily used for substituting text in files or streams. While it can do more, its most common superpower is its ability to perform find-and-replace operations with regular expressions.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Need to change a configuration parameter across 50 files? Update a version number in every script? Remove specific lines from a log? `sed` can do this instantly, often without the need to open a text editor.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Simple Substitution:** Replace "foo" with "bar" in `file.txt` and print to standard output (doesn't modify the file).
    ```bash
    sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
    ```
    *   `s` for substitute, `g` for global (replace all occurrences on a line, not just the first).
*   **In-place Editing:** Replace "old_version" with "new_version" directly in `config.ini`. **Use with caution, always backup!**
    ```bash
    sed -i 's/old_version/new_version/g' config.ini
    ```
*   **Delete Lines:** Remove all lines containing "debug" from `log.txt`.
    ```bash
    sed '/debug/d' log.txt
    ```
*   **Insert Line:** Insert "Header" at the beginning of `data.csv`.
    ```bash
    sed -i '1iHeader' data.csv
    ```

**Advanced Tips:** `sed` can be chained, used for multi-line patterns, and offers a scripting interface for more complex transformations.

## 3. `find`: The File System Cartographer

`find` is a command-line utility for searching files and directories within a specified directory hierarchy based on criteria such as name, type, size, modification time, and permissions.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Your file system can feel like an unnavigable maze. `find` gives you X-ray vision, allowing you to locate files based on incredibly specific criteria, and then *act* upon them. It's essential for system cleanup, security audits, and batch processing of files.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Find by Name:** Locate all files named `report.docx` in the current directory or subdirectories.
    ```bash
    find . -name "report.docx"
    ```
*   **Find by Type (Directory):** Find all directories named `project`
    ```bash
    find . -type d -name "project"
    ```
*   **Find by Size:** Find files larger than 100MB.
    ```bash
    find . -type f -size +100M
    ```
*   **Find by Modification Time:** Find files modified in the last 7 days.
    ```bash
    find . -type f -mtime -7
    ```
*   **Find and Execute:** Find all `.log` files and delete them. **Use with extreme caution!**
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.log" -type f -delete
    ```

**Advanced Tips/Combinations:**

*   **Executing Commands on Found Files:** The `-exec` option is incredibly powerful.
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.bak" -exec rm {} \;
    ```
    *   `{}` is a placeholder for the found filename, `\;` terminates the command for each file.
*   **Piping to `xargs` (more efficient for many files):**
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.tmp" -print0 | xargs -0 rm
    ```
    *   `-print0` and `xargs -0` handle filenames with spaces or special characters correctly.

## 4. `xargs`: The Command Executor's Dynamo

`xargs` reads items from standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and executes the command one or more times using these items as arguments.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Many commands are designed to operate on a few explicit arguments, not a long list piped to them. `xargs` bridges this gap, allowing you to take the output of one command (e.g., a list of files from `find`) and feed it as arguments to another command (e.g., `rm`, `mv`, `tar`). It's the ultimate connector for complex command pipelines.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Delete Multiple Files:** As seen with `find`, `xargs` is perfect for deleting many files found by `find`.
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.old" -print0 | xargs -0 rm
    ```
*   **Copy Files to a New Location:** Copy all `jpg` images found to a `backup` directory.
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.jpg" -print0 | xargs -0 cp -t ~/backup/
    ```
    *   `cp -t` specifies the target directory first.
*   **Run a Command on Each Item:** Ping a list of IP addresses stored in `ips.txt`.
    ```bash
    cat ips.txt | xargs -I {} ping -c 1 {}
    ```
    *   `-I {}` specifies that `{}` will be replaced by each line from `ips.txt`. `-c 1` means ping once.

**Advanced Tips:** `xargs` has powerful options for controlling how many arguments are passed per command, maximum processes, and specific delimiters, making it highly versatile for parallel processing or batch operations.

## 5. `tmux` / `screen`: The Session Preservers

`tmux` (Terminal MUltipleXer) and `screen` are terminal multiplexers. They allow you to create, access, and control multiple terminal sessions from a single window. More importantly, they enable you to "detach" from a session and leave processes running, then "re-attach" later, even from a different location.

**Why it's a Superpower:**
*   **Persistence:** Your long-running script won't die if your SSH connection drops.
*   **Multitasking:** Work on multiple tasks in different panes or windows within one terminal window.
*   **Collaboration:** Share a session with another user (e.g., for pair programming or debugging).

**Key Usage Examples (`tmux` examples, `screen` has similar concepts):**

*   **Start a new session:**
    ```bash
    tmux new -s my_project
    ```
*   **Detach from a session:** Press `Ctrl+b` then `d`.
*   **List existing sessions:**
    ```bash
    tmux ls
    ```
*   **Re-attach to a session:**
    ```bash
    tmux attach -t my_project
    ```
*   **Split panes (inside a session):**
    *   `Ctrl+b` then `"` (horizontal split)
    *   `Ctrl+b` then `%` (vertical split)
*   **Navigate panes:** `Ctrl+b` then arrow keys.
*   **Create new window:** `Ctrl+b` then `c`.
*   **Switch windows:** `Ctrl+b` then `n` (next), `p` (previous), or `[0-9]` for specific window number.

**Advanced Tips:** Configure `tmux.conf` or `.screenrc` for custom keybindings, status bars, and auto-start behaviors.

## 6. `jq`: The JSON Whisperer

In today's API-driven, cloud-native world, JSON is ubiquitous. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It allows you to slice, filter, map, and transform structured data with ease.

**Why it's a Superpower:** Parsing JSON output from `curl` or `kubectl` with traditional text tools like `grep` or `awk` is cumbersome and error-prone. `jq` understands the JSON structure, letting you navigate nested objects and arrays, extract specific values, and even reformat the output with simple, powerful syntax.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Pretty Print JSON:** Make unformatted JSON readable.
    ```bash
    cat data.json | jq .
    ```
*   **Extract a Field:** Get the "name" field from a JSON object.
    ```bash
    echo '{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30}' | jq .name
    # Output: "Alice"
    ```
*   **Access Nested Fields:** Get the city from a nested address object.
    ```bash
    echo '{"user": {"address": {"city": "New York"}}}' | jq .user.address.city
    # Output: "New York"
    ```
*   **Filter Array Elements:** Get names of users older than 25.
    ```bash
    echo '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 20}]' | jq '.[] | select(.age > 25) | .name'
    # Output: "Alice"
    ```
*   **Create New JSON:** Transform existing data into a new JSON structure.
    ```bash
    echo '{"items": [{"id":1,"val":10},{"id":2,"val":20}]}' | jq '{total_value: (.items | map(.val) | add)}'
    # Output: { "total_value": 30 }
    ```

**Advanced Tips:** `jq` has an extensive set of operators and functions for array manipulation, string operations, and conditional logic. It's a mini-programming language for JSON.

## 7. `rsync`: The Data Synchronizer

`rsync` is a fast and versatile command-line utility for synchronizing files and directories between two locations, locally or over a network.

**Why it's a Superpower:**
*   **Efficiency:** It only transfers the differences between files, not entire files, making it incredibly fast for incremental backups and updates.
*   **Flexibility:** Supports local copying, remote-to-local, local-to-remote, and remote-to-remote (via SSH).
*   **Robustness:** Can resume interrupted transfers and preserves file attributes (permissions, timestamps, ownership).
*   **Power for DevOps:** Essential for deploying applications, backing up servers, and maintaining consistent data across systems.

**Key Usage Examples:**

*   **Basic Synchronization (Local):** Copy `source_dir` to `dest_dir` on the same machine.
    ```bash
    rsync -avz source_dir/ dest_dir/
    ```
    *   `-a` (archive mode): Preserves permissions, ownership, timestamps, and recursively copies.
    *   `-v` (verbose): Shows progress.
    *   `-z` (compress): Compresses data during transfer (useful over network).
    *   Trailing slash on `source_dir/` means copy *contents*, no slash means copy the directory itself.
*   **Remote Backup (Local to Remote):** Copy a local directory to a remote server.
    ```bash
    rsync -avz /var/www/html user@remote-server:/backup/web/
    ```
*   **Remote Synchronization (Remote to Local):** Pull updates from a remote server.
    ```bash
    rsync -avz user@remote-server:/path/to/data/ ~/local_data/
    ```
*   **Delete extra files:** Remove files from the destination that are not in the source. **Use with extreme caution!**
    ```bash
    rsync -avz --delete source_dir/ dest_dir/
    ```
*   **Dry Run:** See what `rsync` *would* do without actually making changes. Always do a dry run first when using `--delete`!
    ```bash
    rsync -avzn source_dir/ dest_dir/
    ```
    *   `-n` or `--dry-run`

**Advanced Tips:** `rsync` has options for excluding files, limiting bandwidth, using different SSH ports, and checking file checksums for more robust verification.
