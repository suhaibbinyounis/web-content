title: Applied Physics in Computing
description: Applied Physics in Computing bridges the principles of physical science with real-world computing systems. It’s the foundation behind semiconductors, optics in sensors and displays, thermodynamics in hardware design, and wave mechanics in wireless communication. For developers, it offers insights into how code interacts with circuits, devices, and the physical environments they operate in—unlocking smarter, faster, and more efficient tech solutions.

Physics isn’t just theoretical—it powers the digital world we build and interact with daily. From understanding how electrons travel through transistors to optimizing energy flow in CPUs and GPUs, applied physics helps developers better grasp the invisible forces at play. This section dives into how classical and modern physics principles intersect with computing, helping you build systems that are not just functional, but physically optimized.
