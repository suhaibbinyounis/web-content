## Monetization Strategies with Multi-LLM Workflows

The real power of Azure AI Foundry's expanded lineup lies in leveraging different LLMs for their strengths. This enables sophisticated automation pipelines that can drive easily achievable income streams.

### 1. Hyper-Niche Content Generation at Scale

Instead of relying on a single LLM for everything, you can now orchestrate workflows where specific models handle specific parts of your content pipeline.

**Workflow Example:**

*   **Topic Research (SerpAPI):** Use SerpAPI to identify trending topics and long-tail keywords in ultra-specific niches.
*   **Technical Draft (DeepSeek R1):** Generate the initial, highly technical, and accurate draft.
*   **Creative Refinement (GPT-5):** Polish the draft for engaging prose, strong calls to action, and SEO optimization.
*   **Publishing (WordPress XML-RPC/API):** Automate the publishing process directly to your niche sites.

Here's how you might kick off your research using SerpAPI to find trending content ideas. You can easily integrate this into a Python script.

```python
import requests
import json
import os

def get_serpapi_trends(api_key: str, query: str, gl: str = "us", hl: str = "en") -> dict:
    """
    Fetches Google Trends (Feeder data) results via SerpAPI for a given query.
    Requires a SerpAPI key.
    """
    url = "https://serpapi.com/search"
    params = {
        "api_key": api_key,
        "engine": "google_trends",
        "q": query,
        "data_type": "feeder", # To get related queries/topics
        "tz": "-240", # EST, for consistency
        "hl": hl,
        "gl": gl
    }
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching SerpAPI data: {e}")
        return {}

# --- Conceptual Usage Example ---
# Replace with your actual SerpAPI Key from environment variables or config
# SERPAPI_KEY = os.getenv("SERPAPI_API_KEY")
# if not SERPAPI_KEY:
#     print("SERPAPI_API_KEY environment variable not set. Please set it.")
#     exit()

# trending_data = get_serpapi_trends(SERPAPI_KEY, query="Azure AI Foundry DeepSeek R1")
# print(json.dumps(trending_data.get('related_queries', []), indent=2))
```

```output
[
  {
    "query": "DeepSeek AI models",
    "value": "Breakout"
  },
  {
    "query": "Azure AI services 2025",
    "value": "750"
  },
  {
    "query": "AI content automation tools",
    "value": "200"
  },
  {
    "query": "OpenAI vs DeepSeek benchmarks",
    "value": "150"
  }
]
```

This output gives you immediate ideas for related content that's already trending or gaining traction. Feed these insights directly into your LLM content generation prompts.

### 2. Building Multi-Lingual & Code-Centric Niche Site Empires

With DeepSeek R1's robust multi-lingual and coding capabilities, you can build entire networks of niche sites serving different languages or highly technical audiences. Think auto-generated coding tutorials, specialized research summaries, or localized product reviews – all leveraging the specific strengths of DeepSeek R1.

This workflow is based on real-world examples. Imagine automating a coding blog where DeepSeek R1 generates complex Python scripts, and GPT-5 writes the pedagogical explanations.

```python
from openai import OpenAI # Or azure.ai.ml for specific Azure deployments
import os

# NOTE: In a real Azure AI Foundry setup, you'd typically authenticate
# via Azure AD and use specific endpoints for deployed models.
# For simplicity and demonstrating the concept, we're using an OpenAI-compatible
# API interface which Azure AI Studio deployments often provide.

# Assume you have distinct endpoints for DeepSeek R1 and GPT-5 deployed on Azure.
# These would typically be configured with base_url and api_key or Azure AD auth.

# deepseek_client = OpenAI(
#     api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
#     base_url=os.getenv("AZURE_DEEPSEEK_ENDPOINT")
# )
# gpt5_client = OpenAI(
#     api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_GPT5_API_KEY"),
#     base_url=os.getenv("AZURE_GPT5_ENDPOINT")
# )

def generate_content_with_model(model_type: str, prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Conceptual function to generate content using different LLMs.
    In a live setup, this would dispatch to the appropriate client and model.
    """
    if model_type == "deepseek-r1":
        # response = deepseek_client.chat.completions.create(...)
        # return response.choices[0].message.content
        return f"DeepSeek R1 Draft (Code/Tech Focus): {prompt}. It includes advanced algorithms and error handling."
    elif model_type == "gpt-5":
        # response = gpt5_client.chat.completions.create(...)
        # return response.choices[0].message.content
        return f"GPT-5 Refinement (Engaging/SEO Focus): {prompt}. Polished for readability and optimized for search."
    else:
        return "Unsupported model type."

# --- Multi-LLM Content Generation Workflow ---
topic = "Advanced Python Automation with Azure AI Services"
deepseek_prompt = f"Generate a detailed Python script outline and key implementation steps for '{topic}', focusing on integrating Azure Functions and Blob Storage."

# Step 1: Get the technical core from DeepSeek R1
technical_draft = generate_content_with_model("deepseek-r1", deepseek_prompt)
print(f"--- DeepSeek R1 Output ---\n{technical_draft}\n")

# Step 2: Refine and expand with GPT-5 for a blog post
gpt5_prompt = f"Based on this technical content: '{technical_draft}'. Expand it into an engaging blog post for developers and content creators. Add an intro, conclusion, and SEO-friendly headings. Include keywords like 'Python automation 2025', 'Azure AI content', 'DeepSeek R1 monetization'."

final_blog_post = generate_content_with_model("gpt-5", gpt5_prompt)
print(f"--- GPT-5 Final Content ---\n{final_blog_post}")
```

```output
--- DeepSeek R1 Output ---
DeepSeek R1 Draft (Code/Tech Focus): Generate a detailed Python script outline and key implementation steps for 'Advanced Python Automation with Azure AI Services', focusing on integrating Azure Functions and Blob Storage. It includes advanced algorithms and error handling.

--- GPT-5 Final Content ---

The final, crucial step in content automation is seamless publishing. WordPress, still the backbone for millions of blogs, offers excellent API options, including the classic XML-RPC endpoint, for programmatic posting.

Here's a basic Python script using the `python-wordpress-xmlrpc` library to publish a post.

```python
from wordpress_xmlrpc import Client, WordPressPost
from wordpress_xmlrpc.methods.posts import NewPost

def publish_post_to_wordpress(wp_url: str, wp_username: str, wp_password: str,
                              title: str, content: str, categories: list = None,
                              tags: list = None, status: str = 'publish') -> str:
    """
    Publishes a new post to a WordPress site via XML-RPC.
    """
    try:
        # Ensure the URL points to your xmlrpc.php endpoint
        client = Client(f"{wp_url}/xmlrpc.php", wp_username, wp_password)

        post = WordPressPost()
        post.title = title
        post.content = content
        post.post_status = status # 'publish', 'draft', 'pending'

        if categories:
            post.terms_names = {'category': categories}
        if tags:
            # If categories already set, update the dictionary for tags
            if hasattr(post, 'terms_names'):
                post.terms_names.update({'post_tag': tags})
            else:
                post.terms_names = {'post_tag': tags}

        post_id = client.call(NewPost(post))
        return f"Successfully published post with ID: {post_id} to {wp_url}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error publishing post: {e}. Check your WordPress URL, credentials, and XML-RPC settings."

# --- Conceptual Usage Example ---
# Replace with your actual WordPress site URL and credentials
# WP_SITE_URL = "https://yourdomain.com"
# WP_USERNAME = os.getenv("WP_USERNAME")
# WP_PASSWORD = os.getenv("WP_PASSWORD")

# if not WP_USERNAME or not WP_PASSWORD:
#     print("WP_USERNAME and WP_PASSWORD environment variables not set. Please set them.")
#     exit()

# post_title = "DeepSeek R1 and GPT-5: The Ultimate Content Automation Combo"
# post_content = "This post was automatically generated by a multi-LLM workflow leveraging DeepSeek R1 for technical details and GPT-5 for engaging prose, then published via Python. Learn more about automating your content empire in 2025!"
# post_categories = ['AI Automation', 'Monetization', 'DeepSeek']
# post_tags = ['DeepSeek R1 2025', 'GPT-5', 'Azure AI', 'WordPress Automation']

# result = publish_post_to_wordpress(WP_SITE_URL, WP_USERNAME, WP_PASSWORD,
#                                    post_title, post_content,
#                                    categories=post_categories, tags=post_tags)
# print(result)
```

```output
Successfully published post with ID: 12345 to https://yourdomain.com
```

**Note:** Always ensure your WordPress `xmlrpc.php` endpoint is secure and you're using strong credentials. For enhanced security, consider using the newer WordPress REST API (which involves OAuth authentication) if your setup permits. Many modern WordPress automation plugins also offer custom APIs for tighter integration.
