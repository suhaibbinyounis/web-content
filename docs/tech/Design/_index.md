Every developer, at some point, asks: _“Is there a better way to structure this code?”_ That’s where **design patterns** step in. These architectural blueprints help developers build robust, flexible, and efficient software systems. This section explores essential design patterns, from creational patterns like Singleton and Factory to structural patterns like Adapter and Decorator, and behavioral patterns like Observer and Strategy. Each pattern is presented with real-world examples to show practical applications.
