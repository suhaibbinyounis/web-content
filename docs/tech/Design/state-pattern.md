The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class, encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate, distinct classes. This approach primarily aims to eliminate complex, monolithic conditional statements (`if/else if` or `switch/case`) that manage state-dependent logic.

## 1. Introduction

The State Pattern is particularly useful in systems where an object's behavior varies significantly depending on its current internal state. Instead of relying on large conditional blocks within a single class, the pattern delegates state-specific behavior to separate state objects. Each state object implements a common interface, and the context object simply delegates requests to its current state object. This promotes a cleaner, more modular, and maintainable codebase, especially for applications involving Finite State Machines (FSMs).

Common applications include:
*   Implementing different behaviors for a document based on its status (e.g., Draft, Moderation, Published).
*   Managing the lifecycle of orders in an e-commerce system (e.g., New, Paid, Shipped, Delivered).
*   Controlling media playback (e.g., Playing, Paused, Stopped).

## 2. Implementation

To illustrate, consider a `MediaPlayer` that can be in `Playing`, `Paused`, or `Stopped` states. The behavior of `play()`, `pause()`, and `stop()` methods depends on the current state.

```python
# 1. State Interface: Declares methods common to all concrete states.
class PlayerState:
    def play(self):
        pass
    def pause(self):
        pass
    def stop(self):
        pass

# 2. Concrete States: Implement behavior associated with a specific state.
#    They can also handle state transitions.

class PlayingState(PlayerState):
    def play(self):
        print("Already playing.")
        return self # Stays in current state

    def pause(self):
        print("Pausing playback.")
        return PausedState() # Transitions to PausedState

    def stop(self):
        print("Stopping playback.")
        return StoppedState() # Transitions to StoppedState

class PausedState(PlayerState):
    def play(self):
        print("Resuming playback.")
        return PlayingState() # Transitions to PlayingState

    def pause(self):
        print("Already paused.")
        return self # Stays in current state

    def stop(self):
        print("Stopping playback.")
        return StoppedState() # Transitions to StoppedState

class StoppedState(PlayerState):
    def play(self):
        print("Starting playback.")
        return PlayingState() # Transitions to PlayingState

    def pause(self):
        print("Cannot pause, not playing.")
        return self # Stays in current state

    def stop(self):
        print("Already stopped.")
        return self # Stays in current state

# 3. Context: Contains an instance of a concrete state that defines
#    its current behavior. It delegates state-specific requests to this instance.
class MediaPlayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._state: PlayerState = StoppedState() # Initial state

    def set_state(self, state: PlayerState):
        print(f"Changing state from {type(self._state).__name__} to {type(state).__name__}")
        self._state = state

    # Delegates behavior to the current state object
    def play(self):
        new_state = self._state.play()
        if new_state and new_state is not self._state:
            self.set_state(new_state)

    def pause(self):
        new_state = self._state.pause()
        if new_state and new_state is not self._state:
            self.set_state(new_state)

    def stop(self):
        new_state = self._state.stop()
        if new_state and new_state is not self._state:
            self.set_state(new_state)

# Usage Example:
player = MediaPlayer()

player.play()    # Output: Changing state from StoppedState to PlayingState, Starting playback.
player.pause()   # Output: Changing state from PlayingState to PausedState, Pausing playback.
player.play()    # Output: Changing state from PausedState to PlayingState, Resuming playback.
player.stop()    # Output: Changing state from PlayingState to StoppedState, Stopping playback.
player.pause()   # Output: Cannot pause, not playing.
player.play()    # Output: Changing state from StoppedState to PlayingState, Starting playback.
player.stop()    # Output: Changing state from PlayingState to StoppedState, Stopping playback.
```

## 3. Mermaid Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    MediaPlayer --> PlayerState;
    PlayerState <|-- PlayingState;
    PlayerState <|-- PausedState;
    PlayerState <|-- StoppedState;
```

*   **MediaPlayer (Context):** The object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. It holds a reference to a `PlayerState` object.
*   **PlayerState (State Interface):** Defines a common interface for all concrete state objects.
*   **PlayingState, PausedState, StoppedState (Concrete States):** Implement the `PlayerState` interface, providing specific behaviors for each state and handling transitions to other states.

## 4. Pros & Cons

### Advantages:
*   **Decoupling:** Separates state-specific behavior into distinct classes, reducing the complexity of the context class.
*   **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to add new states or modify existing ones without altering other states or the context. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.
*   **Reduced Conditionals:** Eliminates large, complex conditional statements (`if/else if`, `switch/case`) inside the context class, making the code cleaner and more readable.
*   **Encapsulation:** State-specific logic is encapsulated within its respective state class, improving organization.

### Disadvantages:
*   **Increased Classes:** Can lead to a proliferation of classes, especially for systems with a large number of states and transitions, potentially increasing overall complexity.
*   **Overhead for Simple Cases:** For simple state machines with few states or straightforward transitions, the pattern might introduce unnecessary overhead and complexity.
*   **Transition Visibility:** Understanding the complete flow of state transitions may require examining multiple state classes, which can sometimes be less intuitive than a single conditional block for small cases.
