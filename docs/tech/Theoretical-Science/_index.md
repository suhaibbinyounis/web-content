At its core, theoretical science is about seeking deeper truthsâ€”not just describing how things are, but uncovering *why* they are that way. From quantum mechanics to string theory, it provides the language to model reality, push the boundaries of knowledge, and inspire new technologies through pure reasoning and rigorous logic.
