Alright, let's dive into the theory behind heaps!  Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds.  We'll explore the core concepts – what a heap actually *is*,  the different types (min-heap, max-heap), and why this special tree-based structure is so useful in computer science.  Think of this section as building a solid foundation – once we understand the theory, implementing heaps and using them effectively will become much easier.
