Alright everyone, let's dive into the theory behind greedy algorithms!  Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds.  Think of greedy algorithms as the "grab-what-you-can-now" approach to problem-solving.  We'll explore the core idea of making locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a globally optimal solution.  It's a simple yet powerful concept that often leads to elegant and efficient solutions – let's see how it works!
