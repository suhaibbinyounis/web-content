Hey everyone!  Ready to dive into the world of greedy algorithms?  Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds!  We'll explore this clever approach to problem-solving where we make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find a globally optimal solution.  It's a simple yet powerful technique that can lead to surprisingly efficient code, and we'll walk through some fun examples together. Let's get started!
