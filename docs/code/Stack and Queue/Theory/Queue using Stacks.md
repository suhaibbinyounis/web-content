Working with data structures is fundamental to being a proficient developer. While many languages provide built-in implementations, understanding how they work under the hood – and how to build them from more primitive structures – deepens your knowledge significantly. One classic problem that often appears in interviews and helps solidify these concepts is implementing a Queue using two Stacks.

This post will break down the problem, walk through the logic, provide a complete Python implementation, and analyze its performance.

## The Core Problem: Queue vs. Stack

Before we dive into the solution, let's quickly recap the fundamental differences between a Queue and a Stack:

*   **Stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out):** Think of a stack of plates. You add (push) plates to the top, and you remove (pop) plates from the top. The last plate you put on is the first one you take off.
*   **Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):** Imagine a line at a store. People join (enqueue) at the back, and the person at the front is served (dequeue) first. The first person to join the line is the first one to leave.

The challenge is to replicate FIFO behavior using LIFO data structures.

## The Two-Stack Approach: The Brains of the Operation

The elegant solution involves using two stacks, often referred to as `input_stack` (or `enqueue_stack`) and `output_stack` (or `dequeue_stack`).

Here's the fundamental idea:

1.  **`input_stack`:** This stack is primarily used for the `enqueue` operation. When you add an element, you simply push it onto this stack. This maintains the order of arrival.
2.  **`output_stack`:** This stack is used for `dequeue` and `peek` operations. It holds elements in the correct FIFO order.

The magic happens when you need to `dequeue` an element. Since `input_stack` is LIFO, its top element is the *most recently added*, not the *least recently added* (which is what we need for a queue). To get the least recently added element, we need to reverse the order. This is where the `output_stack` comes in.

**The "Transfer" Operation:**
When you need to `dequeue` or `peek` an element:
*   First, check if the `output_stack` is empty.
*   If `output_stack` is empty, it means we need to transfer elements from `input_stack` to `output_stack`. We do this by popping elements one by one from `input_stack` and pushing them onto `output_stack`. This effectively reverses the order of elements. The first element popped from `input_stack` (which was the *last* one pushed onto `input_stack`) becomes the *last* one pushed onto `output_stack`, and vice-versa. So, the *first* element pushed onto `input_stack` will be the *first* one popped from `output_stack` after the transfer.
*   Once the transfer is complete (or if `output_stack` was already not empty), you can now safely pop/peek from `output_stack` to get the true front element of the queue.

Let's illustrate with an example:

1.  Enqueue 1, 2, 3:
    *   `input_stack`: `[1, 2, 3]` (top is 3)
    *   `output_stack`: `[]`

2.  Dequeue:
    *   `output_stack` is empty.
    *   Transfer from `input_stack` to `output_stack`:
        *   Pop 3 from `input_stack`, push 3 to `output_stack`. `input_stack: [1, 2]`, `output_stack: [3]`
        *   Pop 2 from `input_stack`, push 2 to `output_stack`. `input_stack: [1]`, `output_stack: [3, 2]`
        *   Pop 1 from `input_stack`, push 1 to `output_stack`. `input_stack: []`, `output_stack: [3, 2, 1]` (top is 1)
    *   Now, `output_stack` has `[3, 2, 1]`. Pop from `output_stack` -> returns 1.
    *   `input_stack`: `[]`
    *   `output_stack`: `[3, 2]`

This mechanism ensures that the element at the top of `output_stack` is always the oldest element that was enqueued, thus mimicking FIFO behavior.

## Implementing `QueueUsingStacks` in Python

We'll use Python lists as our underlying stack implementation, as they support `append()` for push and `pop()` for pop efficiently.

### 1. Initializing the Queue

We'll start with a class structure and initialize our two stacks.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []
        print("Queue initialized with two empty stacks.")

# Example Usage:
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
```

### 2. `enqueue(item)`: Adding an Element

This is the straightforward part. Just push the new `item` onto the `input_stack`.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.input_stack.append(item)
        print(f"Enqueued: {item}. input_stack: {self.input_stack}, output_stack: {self.output_stack}")

# Example Usage:
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
my_queue.enqueue(10)
my_queue.enqueue(20)
my_queue.enqueue(30)
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
Enqueued: 10. input_stack: [10], output_stack: []
Enqueued: 20. input_stack: [10, 20], output_stack: []
Enqueued: 30. input_stack: [10, 20, 30], output_stack: []
```

### 3. `_transfer_elements()`: The Helper for Dequeue/Peek

This private helper method handles moving elements from `input_stack` to `output_stack` when `output_stack` is empty.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.input_stack.append(item)
        # print(f"Enqueued: {item}. input_stack: {self.input_stack}, output_stack: {self.output_stack}")

    def _transfer_elements(self):
        if not self.output_stack:  # Only transfer if output_stack is empty
            if not self.input_stack: # If both are empty, nothing to transfer
                return

            print("Transferring elements from input_stack to output_stack...")
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())
            print(f"Transfer complete. input_stack: {self.input_stack}, output_stack: {self.output_stack}")

# Example Usage (demonstrating transfer):
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
my_queue.enqueue(1)
my_queue.enqueue(2)
my_queue.enqueue(3)
# Manually call transfer to see its effect
my_queue._transfer_elements()
my_queue.enqueue(4) # Adding more elements after a transfer
print(f"After enqueueing 4: input_stack: {my_queue.input_stack}, output_stack: {my_queue.output_stack}")
my_queue._transfer_elements() # Demonstrating a second transfer (only transfers 4)
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
Transferring elements from input_stack to output_stack...
Transfer complete. input_stack: [], output_stack: [3, 2, 1]
After enqueueing 4: input_stack: [4], output_stack: [3, 2, 1]
Transferring elements from input_stack to output_stack...
Transfer complete. input_stack: [], output_stack: [3, 2, 1, 4]
```

### 4. `dequeue()`: Removing an Element

This method first ensures `output_stack` has elements (by calling `_transfer_elements`), and then pops from it.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.input_stack.append(item)

    def _transfer_elements(self):
        if not self.output_stack:
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())

    def dequeue(self):
        self._transfer_elements()
        if not self.output_stack:
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from empty queue")
        
        item = self.output_stack.pop()
        print(f"Dequeued: {item}. input_stack: {self.input_stack}, output_stack: {self.output_stack}")
        return item

# Example Usage:
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
my_queue.enqueue('A')
my_queue.enqueue('B')
my_queue.enqueue('C')
print(f"Initial state before dequeue: input_stack: {my_queue.input_stack}, output_stack: {my_queue.output_stack}")

my_queue.dequeue()
my_queue.dequeue()
my_queue.enqueue('D') # Add an element after some dequeues
print(f"State after some operations: input_stack: {my_queue.input_stack}, output_stack: {my_queue.output_stack}")
my_queue.dequeue()
my_queue.dequeue() # Dequeue the last element, will trigger transfer again
my_queue.dequeue() # This should raise an error
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
Initial state before dequeue: input_stack: ['A', 'B', 'C'], output_stack: []
Dequeued: A. input_stack: [], output_stack: ['C', 'B']
Dequeued: B. input_stack: [], output_stack: ['C']
State after some operations: input_stack: ['D'], output_stack: ['C']
Dequeued: C. input_stack: ['D'], output_stack: []
Dequeued: D. input_stack: [], output_stack: []
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 39, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 21, in dequeue
IndexError: Dequeue from empty queue
```
Note: The `IndexError` is expected when trying to dequeue from an empty queue, mimicking Python's list `pop()` behavior on an empty list.

### 5. `peek()`: Looking at the Front Element

Similar to `dequeue`, but without removing the element.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.input_stack.append(item)

    def _transfer_elements(self):
        if not self.output_stack:
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())

    def peek(self):
        self._transfer_elements()
        if not self.output_stack:
            raise IndexError("Peek from empty queue")
        
        item = self.output_stack[-1] # Peek without popping
        print(f"Peeked: {item}. input_stack: {self.input_stack}, output_stack: {self.output_stack}")
        return item

# Example Usage:
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
my_queue.enqueue('X')
my_queue.enqueue('Y')
print(f"Current front: {my_queue.peek()}")
my_queue.enqueue('Z')
print(f"Current front after Z: {my_queue.peek()}") # Peek again, should still be X
my_queue.dequeue() # Remove X
print(f"Current front after dequeue: {my_queue.peek()}")
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
Peeked: X. input_stack: [], output_stack: ['Y', 'X']
Peeked: X. input_stack: ['Z'], output_stack: ['Y', 'X']
Dequeued: X. input_stack: ['Z'], output_stack: ['Y']
Peeked: Y. input_stack: ['Z'], output_stack: ['Y']
```

### 6. `is_empty()`: Checking for Emptiness

A queue is empty if both its `input_stack` and `output_stack` are empty.

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.input_stack.append(item)

    def _transfer_elements(self):
        if not self.output_stack:
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())

    def dequeue(self):
        self._transfer_elements()
        if not self.output_stack:
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from empty queue")
        return self.output_stack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        self._transfer_elements()
        if not self.output_stack:
            raise IndexError("Peek from empty queue")
        return self.output_stack[-1]

    def is_empty(self):
        return not self.input_stack and not self.output_stack

# Example Usage:
my_queue = QueueUsingStacks()
print(f"Is queue empty? {my_queue.is_empty()}")
my_queue.enqueue(100)
print(f"Is queue empty? {my_queue.is_empty()}")
my_queue.dequeue()
print(f"Is queue empty? {my_queue.is_empty()}")
```

```output
Queue initialized with two empty stacks.
Is queue empty? True
Is queue empty? False
Dequeued: 100. input_stack: [], output_stack: []
Is queue empty? True
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Understanding the performance characteristics is key to choosing the right data structure.

### Time Complexity:

*   **`enqueue(item)`: O(1)**
    *   Adding an element to `input_stack` is a constant time operation (Python's `list.append()`).
*   **`dequeue()`: O(1) Amortized**
    *   **Worst Case:** If `output_stack` is empty, all `N` elements from `input_stack` must be transferred. This involves `N` pops and `N` pushes, making it O(N) for that specific `dequeue` call.
    *   **Best Case / Average Case:** If `output_stack` is not empty, it's a simple pop, which is O(1).
    *   **Amortized Analysis:** Consider a sequence of `K` enqueue and `K` dequeue operations. Each element is enqueued once (1 push to `input_stack`), transferred once (1 pop from `input_stack` and 1 push to `output_stack`), and dequeued once (1 pop from `output_stack`). This is a total of 4 operations per element over its lifetime in the queue. Thus, `K` operations cost `4K` (roughly), making the amortized cost per operation O(1).
*   **`peek()`: O(1) Amortized**
    *   The logic is identical to `dequeue` regarding the transfer, so its complexity is also O(1) amortized.
*   **`is_empty()`: O(1)**
    *   Checking if two lists are empty is a constant time operation.
*   **`size()`: O(1)**
    *   Summing lengths of two lists is constant time.

### Space Complexity:

*   **O(N)**
    *   Where N is the total number of elements currently in the queue. At any given time, all N elements will reside in either `input_stack` or `output_stack` (or be in the process of transferring). Therefore, the space required grows linearly with the number of elements.

## Why Bother with This? Use Cases and Importance

1.  **Interview Questions:** This is a very common interview question designed to test your understanding of fundamental data structures, your ability to think algorithmically, and your grasp of concepts like amortized analysis.
2.  **Deepening Understanding:** Implementing a queue with stacks forces you to think about how data structures work beyond their abstract definitions. It clarifies the implications of LIFO vs. FIFO.
3.  **Constraint-Based Programming:** While high-level languages usually provide optimized queue implementations, imagine a scenario where you only have access to stack-like primitives (e.g., in a highly constrained embedded environment or when working with a specific API that only exposes stack operations). In such cases, this pattern becomes incredibly useful.
4.  **Learning About Trade-offs:** It highlights that while `enqueue` is always fast, `dequeue`/`peek` can occasionally be slow due to the transfer, but over time, they are efficient. This introduces the concept of amortized analysis, which is important for many algorithms (e.g., dynamic arrays like Python lists).

## Conclusion

Implementing a Queue using two Stacks is a clever solution to a common data structure problem. It elegantly uses the LIFO property of stacks to achieve FIFO behavior, offering a practical example of how one Abstract Data Type (ADT) can be built from another. Understanding this pattern not only bolsters your algorithmic thinking but also provides valuable insights into time complexity analysis, especially amortized costs. It's a testament to the power of thoughtful design in computer science.

Happy coding!
