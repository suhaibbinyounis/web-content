Okay, let's dive into the slightly trickier side of recursion: the problems!  Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds.  Understanding common pitfalls and how to avoid them is key to writing efficient and bug-free recursive functions. We'll explore some typical issues like stack overflow, infinite recursion, and inefficient algorithms, so you can confidently tackle any recursive challenge. Let's get started!
