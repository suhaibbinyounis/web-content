Alright everyone, let's dive into the theory behind dynamic programming!  Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds.  Think of it as a clever strategy for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each one only once, and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.  We'll explore the core concepts – optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems – in a way that makes this powerful technique clear and approachable.
