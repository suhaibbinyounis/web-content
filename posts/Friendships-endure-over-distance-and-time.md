> Good friends are like stars. Even if you don't always see them, you are aware that they exist. It's difficult to forget how special it is to have a best friend. They might only be in our life for a very little period of time, and their departure can be a very difficult adjustment. Still, real friendship is something we can always be thankful for, no matter how long they've been in our lives.

``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which may or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

Everybody has experienced the loss of a friend. I'm sure we all miss them every day of our lives and wish we could share the same memories with them. But the thought that it might never take place in our life again simply makes us sad, a tragic event in life that constantly stings.

Personally, I think that people must be thinking that they won't ever discover a friend with whom they can relate the way they did when they were younger. And that makes sense because when you get older, you have a lot of obligations and spend all of your time at work.

I can see faces when I close my eyes. Faces that I am familiar with. Faces that I haven't seen in a long time. Faces that make me feel at home. I miss them and I want them to know that I do.

Many of us, in my opinion, don't realise what they do until it has repercussions. I'm in the exact same situation. I stopped talking to some of them. I'm certain that they would have made an effort to contact me just to discover that they were unable to. It now enrages me since I didn't try either. The current situation may have been different.

I've always assumed that these memories will stay stable. I carried on with my life and made no effort to develop relationships. And whatever relationships I had were always the result of other people's efforts. Never did I try.

I'm embarrassed to think that someone out there would have thought of me as a friend, and I let them down. Perhaps I began learning about life way too late in my life. I always thought I could live how I wanted, a manner that made sense to me. A course of action that runs counter to what the rest of the world does. A method that I didn't anticipate would let me down.

As I continue to grow in life, my feelings towards this guilt are conflicting. I feel both happiness and sadness over it. Happy because now I realize what had to be done. And also sad because I paid the price and eventually lost.

I reflect on it sometimes. But I'm curious whether they think the same. Do they agree with me in this regard? What if they have made up their minds to quit up already? Afterall, It's not really that difficult. It's all possible in our rapidly evolving world.

Even if they don't. Even if they forgot about me, it doesn't matter. I will always be grateful for every moment that I got to share with them. It's something that I believe has helped me grow as a good human being.

All of this was written with the goal of sharing my life experiences and enriching readers lives. Also, I do not want anyone to go through the same feelings that I've gone through.

In no way, shape, or form am I depressed. These epilogues are just intended to enrich the lives of readers by sharing personal experiences, mostly on issues that are close to our hearts. Things that we don't talk about.
