``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which may or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

I used to have a lot of questions, beliefs, and dreams running around in my head. I'm not sure if this is simply the way people are or if I'm horrible in general. I don't know anything for sure, but it doesn't really matter.

Lately, I have been daydreaming about how awesome it would be to live in a mountainous area. Even though I've been to mountains, it's strange. 

Strange because I have wandered through its wilderness. I've been through its emptiness even though it may look full of nature. However, it doesn't feel the same as it does in my thoughts. I suppose that the neurons in our brain meticulously execute this appearance of excitement and curiosity.

There is more to it than just mountains. In my brain, I often miss a lot of things, but in reality, I have completely different thoughts about it. I'm curious why that is.

Many aspects of our lives are fueled by faith and optimism. But we keep losing the same thing. These tiny victories may brighten certain days, but they also diminish the significance of the next tiny victory. It seems like everything ultimately filters out.

We commit to support one another when we need it. Many do, but few truly mean it. It makes me wonder how much it actually matters.

Life's magic is a fascinating concept. It has a heavy heart and is choked with tears. In this equation of life, time is never a factor. Maybe it's because the average human lifespan is so brief. Everything seems to have a similar outcome.

But while it lasts, it's enjoyable.

Maybe the magic does not exist. Maybe it's not even about the illusion. Maybe it's just that somebody gave it enough thought to make it real for you. They brought the magic to life. The magic is in them. The real ones are those.

Be grateful for their presence in your life.
