> The ideas may exhaust us. They sometimes seem to be hammering us nonstop, and all we want is a break. We are able to delay the thoughts for a while. However, when they linger for days or even weeks at a time, it is more difficult to ignore them or resist them. We get so worn out.

``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which may or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

Many chapters are coming to an end as the new year approaches. Your heart is lacking something, and you still have some remorse. It's not like everything can be repaired. You can't alter certain things that transform you. I think we're all misfits in some way, trying to hide behind a mask of happiness.

Not that our existence is depressing or that we are losing out on anything. The problem is that we keep missing out on things that are not meant for us because we become attached to them. I don't want to miss out on all that life has to offer. Everything makes me grateful. 

We don't, in my opinion, deserve any of it. Imagine millions of people on the earth who are in need of those fundamental necessities that we just ignore. 

It's challenging to keep your heart open, and I don't believe we will ever be able to win the fight that is virtually impossible to win. When your purpose is defeated every time you make progress, it can be challenging to go on in life. We can't really do anything about it. Even if we still make an effort to ignore it, there will always be a dark place within you that fights against you; in an effort to push you into that negative mindset.

I never would have imagined how much internal suffering there is among people. It's similar to an illness that leaves you skeletal after killing you within. As I type this, I can picture several faces that gave me a pleasant feeling within. Love the enthusiasm that some folks always bring to the table when you two cross paths.

Even though what's left of life is imperfect, it's a fresh start. A beginning that may well remain the same yet offers the possibility that things might change at any point. What a strange planet we inhabit!
