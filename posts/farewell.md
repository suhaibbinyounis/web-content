Hey Everyone,

It's hard to believe I'm sitting here, tapping away at these keys, reflecting on this whirlwind of a year. It's been quite a ride, and what truly astounds me is that some of you actually read the chaotic thoughts I share. Seriously, who knew? It's still difficult to wrap my head around.

I've had the pleasure of getting to know some of you personally, and your feedback has been incredible. Although, being the glutton for punishment that I am, I was kind of hoping for a bit more criticism. Let's face it, that's what really pushes me to do better. The best feedback I received came with the caveat, "it's not for everyone." And you know what? That's probably the most honest thing I've read all year.

I can’t exactly pin down why I began posting these odd musings. Maybe it was this urge to just talk about things from my own messed-up perspective. Honestly, I don’t think I've even scratched the surface of what I wanted to express. If I’m being real, barely 5 or 10% of it made it out. So, was it all a waste of energy? Here are my afterthoughts: I was chasing a sense of mental freedom, and it definitely helped. Sure, it was a bit uncomfortable at first—felt like I was baring my soul and leaving myself open to the world. But then, people started sharing their thoughts and reflections too. It was like I wasn’t just helping myself; I was connecting with others in this weird, vulnerable way. And now, I feel a strange sense of peace for having done it.

My main intent behind all this was to connect with a specific, perhaps niche, wavelength of people. And I'm glad it happened. It's been wonderful sharing my views with you all, even if they are sometimes muddled and chaotic.

As I approach the end of this year, I've been contemplating whether it makes sense for me to continue. To be honest, I don't think it does. I won't be writing these anymore. Some of you may have noticed when I changed the subdomain from "blogs" to "notes." This change was not just superficial—it reflected a shift in my own outlook and approach to sharing my thoughts. I'm uncertain whether to take these posts down or create an archive for them. That’s something I’ll need to think about. As for this website, its future is still undecided. But as I ponder these decisions, I am filled with a profound sense of gratitude.

Before I sign off, I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude. I am profoundly thankful for each one of you who has taken the time to read my musings, to connect, and to share your thoughts. Your engagement has been a source of great inspiration and has meant more to me than words can ever convey. Every email, every piece of feedback, and every connection made through these posts has been a treasure. I am incredibly grateful for your support, your patience, and your willingness to engage with my often chaotic thoughts. Your presence has been a gift, and I am humbled by your willingness to journey with me through this process.

So, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Here's to a new year filled with growth, reflection, and endless possibilities.

P.S. You can always break the silence by mailing me at mail@suhaib.in.

With all the gratitude,

Suhaib
