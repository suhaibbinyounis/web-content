Hey everyone, **Suhaib** here. As the embers of another year flicker low, I find myself drawn not to the fire's dying heat, but to the warmth of the memories it leaves behind. It's been a year of twists, turns, and some pretty epic head-scratchers, but through it all, a few threads have woven themselves into the curtains of my reflection.

First, the thread of gratitude. It's easy to get caught in the whirlwind of the "should-haves" and "could-haves," but a pause, a breath, reveals the staggering beauty of simply being. Someone, somewhere, cared enough to share a smile, a conversation, a helping hand. We are all interconnected in this fabric of life, and to be acknowledged, to be felt, is an invaluable present.

Speaking of gifts, the outpouring of support this year has been humbling. People reached out with words of encouragement, shared their own stories, and reminded me that even in the loneliest corners of the internet, connection thrives. It's a testament to the human spirit, this willingness to bridge the gaps and offer solace, and I'm eternally grateful for each outstretched hand.

Of course, alongside gratitude, there's the bittersweet sting of letting go. People, places, even parts of myself, all gracefully or abruptly shifted sands under my feet. It's a dance, this journey, a constant push and pull between holding on and letting fly. But here's the thing, in the letting go, I didn't just leave others, I left me too. The old skin shed, revealing something rawer, more vulnerable, yet somehow, more authentic.

And let's be honest, I haven't always been a shining beacon of punctuality. I've been late to conversations, commitments, even deadlines. But here's the thing: life isn't a train on a set schedule. It's a meandering path through canyons of experience, and sometimes, the most breathtaking vistas are found just off the beaten track. So, to those I've kept waiting, my sincerest apologies, and a promise to keep exploring, even if it takes a few extra detours.

Now, a word to you, whoever's reading this. You are special. Not in some grandiose, Hollywood sense, but in the quiet, undeniable way that every beat of your heart is a testament to the universe's creativity. Your thoughts, your experiences, your unique brushstrokes – they ignite the canvas of existence, and their light is undeniable. So don't let anyone, least of all yourself, dim your light.

Life, of course, isn't without its regrets. Missed opportunities, unkind words, paths not taken – they linger, ghosts at the feast of memory. But here's the comfort: regret isn't a dead end, it's a compass. It points us towards growth, towards learning, towards becoming the gentleman within. The gentleman who owns his mistakes, embraces vulnerability, and offers kindness as freely as he receives it.

So, as the curtain falls on another year, I offer this: thank you. Thank you to those who cared, who reached out, who held my hand through the stumbles. Thank you for the lessons learned, the paths untrodden, and the beauty that still awaits. With every thread, we contribute to the grand story of life. Thank you for being a part of it, humbly weaving your part.

Here's to the next chapter, filled with gratitude, growth, and the gentle hum of the universe whispering, "You're exactly who you need to be."

Until next time,

***Suhaib Bin Younis***
