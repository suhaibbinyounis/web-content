> Without the ability to feel pain, humans would not be aware of potentially hazardous situations or what to do or not do to survive. In the end, it's beneficial for all of us that life is painful.

``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which mayÂ or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

I just realised there are individuals who haven't considered entering the race, who haven't known there is a race to run and a prize to be won. Even as I write this, there are runners on the verge of dropping the baton, both men and women.

The truth is that we are far more eager to brand issues than we are to offer answers. If we were honest with ourselves, we would come to terms with the fact that those we label as menaces, abnormal, and outcasts of society are so not because it is the role society has assigned them and they are happy to play it, but because there is no other option; to them, you are either branded as a menace or die in the dungeon of penury. Choice is only feasible when there are two or more possibilities to choose from, an alternative to consider.

I started to wonder what would have happened to those who had abandoned the race and the batons that were on the ground. It occurred to me that these were war casualties (as the military would say).

Nobody is flawless, as they say, but it doesn't stop us from doing more; from striving to be better. People will always misinterpret you, but that doesn't mean you should keep doing what causes everyone to mistake you.

So, to you, I say, hang in there, keep fighting, keep running; there is power and grace where you least expect it.
