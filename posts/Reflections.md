### I often ask myself, *‘Why do I write?’*

There’s a hell of a lot going on up there. A whole universe of thoughts and feelings, swirling around like a cosmic storm. I write because I need to make sense of it all. To find some order in the chaos. It’s like trying to grab a handful of smoke and shape it into something solid.

I sit down to write, and it feels like I’m staring at a blank canvas, a vast, empty space. I know the masterpiece is in there, somewhere, but getting it out is a battle. It’s like trying to squeeze a watermelon through a straw. Frustrating, messy, and often disappointing.

But there’s a pull, a magnetic force that drags me back. I crave connection, a shared understanding with someone, anyone. To know that I’m not alone in this crazy world, that others feel the same way. It’s like finding a lost tribe, a place where you belong.

Writing is a journey of self-discovery. With each piece, I peel back another layer of the onion, revealing a new side of myself. It’s scary, vulnerable, but also exhilarating. It’s like staring into a mirror and finally seeing your own reflection.

There are days when doubt creeps in, a whispering voice telling me I’m not good enough, that no one cares. But I push through, because I know that on the other side of fear is freedom. Freedom to express myself without judgment, to be truly authentic.

### I find myself wondering, *‘What inspires me?’*

My life is woven with threads of connection, some vibrant and enduring, others faded and frayed. The people who've walked beside me, even for a brief moment, have left indelible marks on my soul. There are those whose laughter is still a familiar melody in my head, even though they've moved on. Their absence is a phantom limb, a constant reminder of what once was.

Then there are the ones who've weathered storms with me, their loyalty a steadfast anchor. We've shared secrets, dreams, and the weight of life's absurdities. These are the bonds forged in fire, tested by time, and deepened by shared experiences.

It's in these relationships, both present and past, that I find the raw material for my writing. The complexities of human connection, the beauty of friendship, and the bittersweet ache of loss are the themes that resonate deepest within me. They are the ghosts in the machine of my mind, haunting my thoughts and inspiring my words.

But it's not just the people in my life who ignite the spark within me. There's a restlessness, a wanderlust that pulls me forward. When I travel, I'm bombarded with sights, sounds, and sensations that ignite my imagination. A bustling marketplace, a solitary figure on a hill, or even a fleeting glance at a stranger can spark a story. These moments of wonder and curiosity are the fuel that keeps me inspired.

### I often reflect on, *‘What’s the message I’m trying to give?’*

Sometimes it feels like there’s a whole universe of thoughts and feelings trapped inside my head, just waiting to burst out. I sit down to write, ready to spill my guts, but the words come out all jumbled and messy. It’s like trying to explain a dream – you know exactly what you saw, but describing it feels impossible.

I guess what I really want to say is that it’s tough being human. We all have our own stuff going on, our own unique struggles and joys. And sometimes, sharing those experiences can be a lifeline. Maybe someone out there reads my words and feels less alone. That would be pretty amazing.

I want to be fearless with my words. To say what I really think without holding back. But it’s scary, tbh. What if people judge me? What if I’m completely wrong? But I’m trying to let go of that fear. To be authentic, even if it means putting myself out there.

I want to break free from the mental prison I've built around myself. I want to say what I really think, without fear of judgment. And maybe, just maybe, I'll find my voice in the process.

So, here’s to the endless search for meaning. The never-ending quest to find my voice. And the hope that maybe, just maybe, I can make a difference.

I'm incredibly grateful for this platform to share my thoughts and connect with you all. It's a privilege to be able to put my feelings into words and hope they resonate with someone out there. Life is a precious gift, and none of us are guaranteed tomorrow. So, while you're here, make sure to tell your loved ones how much they mean to you. A simple "I love you" can make all the difference. Let's cherish every moment and build a world filled with love, kindness, and understanding.
