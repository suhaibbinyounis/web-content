> We humans have a bit of a problem with reality. We experience it all the time  but struggle to define it, let alone understand it. It seems so solid and yet, when we examine it closely, it melts away like a mirage. We don’t know when it began, how big it is, where it came from and where it is going, and we certainly have no clue why it exists.

``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which may or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

Why even bother attempting to define reality? What does it change? Or perhaps I should say, would knowing it even affect my anxieties or pleasant times. In fact, we don't even live most of our lives on our own. It's a stair composed of broken hearts and compromises. We do raise ourselves, though briefly. But after that, we regress as though it were irrelevant.

Sure, we don't live in a vacuum. We're all part of a bigger society, and we can't always control everything that happens around us. But that doesn't mean we're powerless. We can still take ownership of our lives and make choices that align with our values and desires.

The question of why bother attempting to define reality is a valid one, as it is natural to question the value of such an endeavor. However, understanding reality is crucial to making informed decisions and taking meaningful actions. Without a shared understanding of reality, communication and cooperation become challenging, leading to misunderstandings, conflict, and ultimately, chaos.

When we look at the state of the world today, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and hopeless. But here's the thing: we can still make a difference. Even if it's just in our own little corner of the world. We may not be able to change everything, but we can work towards creating a better future for ourselves and those around us.

So yeah, figuring out reality might not be the most exciting or glamorous thing in the world. But it's important. It gives us a sense of direction and purpose, and it can help us make the most of the time we have on this planet.

Someone once told me that whatever is irreplacable is real. Maybe that's true. It just takes some deep thoughts to understand. But that's a really interesting perspective. When something is truly irreplaceable, it's like nothing else can quite compare to it. It's unique, special, and maybe even a little bit magical. And I think that's what makes it feel real.

When we think about the things in our lives that we truly cherish - our loved ones, our passions, our experiences - those are the things that we can't imagine living without. They're the things that make life worth living. And maybe that's because they're the things that feel the most real to us.

Of course, there are also things in life that are more tangible and measurable - things like money, possessions, and status. But I think most of us would agree that those things aren't what really matter in life. They might make our lives easier or more comfortable, but they don't bring us the same kind of joy and fulfillment as the things that are truly irreplaceable.

So maybe the key to understanding reality is to focus on those things that are irreplaceable. To cherish them, protect them, and nurture them. Because those are the things that are truly real. And when we have a deep appreciation for what's really important in life, everything else seems to fall into place.

And let's be real, life can be tough. It's not always rainbows and butterflies. We face challenges, heartbreaks, and disappointments along the way. But that doesn't mean we should give up or resign ourselves to a life of misery.

We are capable of learning, growing, and changing. And sometimes, that means facing difficult truths and accepting things that are out of our control. It can be scary, but it's also empowering to recognize that we have agency in our lives and that we can make choices that lead us towards greater fulfillment.

Of course, understanding reality isn't a magic solution to all our problems. It's just one piece of the puzzle. But it's an important one. When we have a clear picture of what's going on around us, we can make better decisions about how to move forward. We can be more thoughtful, more intentional, and more compassionate towards ourselves and others.
