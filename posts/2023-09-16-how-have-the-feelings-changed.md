> In the midst of life’s chaos, my thoughts often find themselves in a state of confusion. The clarity that once seemed to be within my grasp now eludes me, replaced by a thick haze of doubt. Yet, amidst this confusion, there is an emotion that remains constant - love.

``` This is an epilogue of thoughts, which may or may not have any logical sequence or even make sense. ```

Welcome to the rollercoaster ride of thoughts, cleverly disguised as an essay. This isn’t your typical essay; it’s more like a question-answer session with a twist of humor. Imagine it as a late-night talk show where the guest is your emotions, and the host is your curiosity. Each paragraph is like a question fired by the host, digging deeper into the guest’s life. So buckle up, grab your popcorn, and enjoy the ride as we dive into the depths of feelings, love, kindness, pain, humanity, and meaning. And remember, laughter is highly encouraged!

"How have the feelings changed?" This question has served me as a mirror reflecting my inner self. It prompts introspection and self-awareness, urging me to confront my emotional changes head-on rather than shying away from them. This introspective journey leads to profound self-discovery and personal growth. It’s like going on a road trip with your emotions, but without the need for rest stops or snacks (although, let’s be honest, snacks make everything better).

“How has love changed?” Amidst life’s chaos, my thoughts often find themselves in a state of confusion. The clarity that once seemed to be within my grasp now eludes me, replaced by a thick haze of doubt. Yet, amidst this confusion, there is an emotion that remains constant - love. It’s like that one sock that always manages to stay in the laundry cycle while its pair mysteriously disappears. 

Why don’t potatoes ever get into fights? Because they’re afraid of getting mashed! 😄 You are welcome for the lame joke :)

“How has kindness changed?” In the past, I was soft, always ready to extend a helping hand to others. But as time passed, I realized the importance of self-reliance. I learned that while it’s noble to help others, it’s equally important to help oneself. This shift in perspective was not easy but necessary for my personal growth. It’s like realizing you’ve been pouring milk before cereal all this time.

Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! 

Now that was a good one right!

“How has pain changed?” Things that used to hurt don’t anymore. It’s not that I’ve become numb or indifferent; rather, I’ve learned to accept and move on. This acceptance has brought about a sense of peace and resilience within me. It’s like finally learning how to ride a bike without training wheels - there might be a few falls along the way, but eventually, you get the hang of it.

“How has humanity changed?” Sometimes, I wonder if I’m even human anymore because I don’t feel like how early me used to. But then I realize that this change is not a loss of humanity but a sign of maturity. It’s the wisdom gained from life experiences that has shaped me into who I am today. It’s like realizing you’ve outgrown your favorite childhood cartoon - it doesn’t make the show any less significant; it just means you’ve grown.

“How has meaning changed?” Maybe it is the loneliness and eternal despair of a man who never found his place in the world. Maybe it is the complexities of human relationships, the pain and disappointment that came from unmet expectations. Maybe it is the wisdom of life, the realization that nothing lasts forever, that everything is impermanent and transient.

I don’t know the answer to these questions. Maybe there is no answer. Maybe there is no meaning. Maybe there is no feeling. Or maybe it’s like looking for your glasses when they’re on your head all along.

And maybe that’s why we all long for something more. Something deeper. Something real. A connection that transcends the superficial and the mundane. An understanding that goes beyond words and actions. A feeling that fills the void and makes us whole again.

As we navigate through life’s journey, we are constantly evolving - our feelings, our perceptions, our very essence. We learn to adapt, to grow from our experiences, and in doing so, we discover new facets of ourselves we never knew existed.

In this constant state of flux, we may sometimes feel lost or disconnected from our former selves. But it’s important to remember that this is not a loss but a transformation - a testament to our resilience and capacity for growth.

So here’s to embracing change - in our feelings, in our lives, and most importantly, in ourselves - because change is the only constant in life (well, that and taxes).
